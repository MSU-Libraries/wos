NONE	Sole-cropped, unfertilized maize is the dominant cropping system throughout southern Africa. Yields have become stagnant and legumes are frequently advocated as an affordable option for resource poor farmers, to enhance productivity. Farmer participatory research was employed to test legume intensification as a means to improve maize-based systems in Malawi. A range of,options were evaluated, from grain/legume intercrops of. long-duration pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) rotated with maize (Zea mays), to a relay green manure system of maize with Tephrosia vogelii (Fishbean). Two years of on-farm experimentation indicated that under on-farm conditions legume-intensified systems produced residues that contained about 50 kg N/ha per year, two-fold higher than sole-cropped maize residues. Grain yields from legume-intensified systems were comparable to yields from continuous sole maize, even in a dry lakeshore ecology. These preliminary findings were linked to farmer assessment, where farmers participating in the trials expressed strong interest in the technologies. Yet the probability of adoption remains uncertain. Associated surveys outlined constraints and trade-offs underlying technology choice, information that is not usually considered in conjunction with on-farm trials. Although the legumes were highly productive, farmers expressed worries about the marginal loss of maize production. While the trial performance was similar across regions, differences in market condition, farm resources and household composition appears to stimulate different technology choices. Farmers weigh the benefits of weed suppression and potential cash earnings, against the costs of seed, problems of seed access, labor requirements and problems of grain market access and price. Surveyed farmers commonly manage residues by burning. Promotion and experimentation with more efficient use of legume residues may offer higher short-term impacts than efforts to promote adoption of another cash crop. Ultimately, adoption and soil fertility benefits may depend on market returns to legume production. This study documents the value of researchers and farmers partnering in evaluation of technologies, adoption constraints and competing technology choices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mullsp.] in different intercropping combinations with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.).  Groundnut ('JL 24') and long-duration redgram ('LRG 30') intercropping system in 7:1 ratio was more stable and profitable than goundnut ('JL 24') + short-duration redgram ('ICPL 87').  In the 7:1 intercropping ratio the seed yields of short- and long-duration redgram was 96 and 670 kg/ha respectively.  Maximum groundnut equivalent (2,193 kg/ha), land-equivalent ratio (1.61) and net returns (7,345 Rs/ha) were obtained in groundnut ('JL 24') with long-duration redgram ('LRG 30') in 7:1 ratio, which was higher than short-duration redgram in all intercropping ratios.	1	WOS:A1991HP42600019	0	NONE	NONE	SELVAM, VS; RAJAN, MSS	1991	TS=("long duration" NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE	
NONE	NONE	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES	RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF LONG-DURATION PIGEONPEA (CAJANUS-CAJAN) OF DIFFERENT GROWTH HABITS AS SOLE CROP AND IN INTERCROP	NONE	An experiment was conducted during 1985-86 and 1986-87 to study the relative performance of long-duration pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Mill sp.] genotypes of different canopy habits in sole crops and intercrops with pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend. Stuntz]. In both the seasons no interaction between grain yield of pigeonpea genotypes in sole crops and intercrops was observed, suggesting the validity of selecting progeny of long-duration pigeonpea in sole crops for eventual use in intercropping systems. These results are attributed to the long period, after the harvest of the intercropped pearl millet, over which long-duration pigeonpea can compensate for any differential competitive effects at early growth stages. The major factor determining yield appeared to be length of growing period, which was in tum determined by genotype and the environmental conditions following pearl millet harvest.	0	WOS:A1992JK83600002	0	NONE	NONE	JOHANSEN, C; CHAUHAN, YS; SAXENA, NP; SINGH, H; TIWARI, AS; CHAUHAN, YS; FARIS, DG	1992	TS=("long duration" NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE

The crop was grown at two spacings as it was expected that crop density could interact with the crop's ability to extract soil moisture. The irrigation treatment received furrow irrigation four times during the 1990-91 and 1992-93 seasons and twice during the 1991-92 season. Grain yields of all genotypes were 11% higher when planted at higher density than at low density. There was a differential variation in yield and harvest index among genotypes due to season but not due to spacing and irrigation suggesting the validity of the present approach of testing genotypes under optimum conditions. Grain yield declined by 21% from the 1990 to 1992 season. The decline was > 1 t/ha in some cultivars (ICPL 366, GW3), and between 0.5 and 1.0 t/ha in others (NP [WR] 15, ICP 87143 and ICPL 84072). In others (Bahar, ICP 9174, ICP 8860) the yield fluctuation was < 0.5 t/ha. The genotypes' mean yields were as high as 2.7 t/ha for ICPL 87143, ICPL 84072 and ICPL 366. There was a significant reduction in both grain yield (16%), and also above-ground plant dry mass (18 %) due to soil moisture limitation in the unirrigated treatment. Both the above-ground plant dry mass and grain yields were significantly more at high plant density than at lower plant density especially with irrigation. The genotypes were found to differ in their response to production environment (irrigation, spacing and to the undefined differences of the 3 years). Genotypic variation in yield within a production environment was found to vary in relation to changes in harvest index and across environment (irrigation, seasons) due to variation in total dry matter production. A lack of negative relationship between the total dry matter and harvest index suggests the possibility of optimizing both for obtaining higher yield from long-duration genotypes.	1	WOS:000168678400004	17	NONE	WATER-USE	Rao, JVBKK; Johansen, C; Chauhan, YS; Chauhan, YS; Jain, VK; Jain, KC; Talwar, HS	2001	TS=("long duration" NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE

Experiment consisted four plant populations (88888, 66666, 5333 and 44444 plants ha(-1)) and two planting methods (Ridge and Flat bed), with four replications in randomized block design. Results revealed that ridge planting method influnced the seed yield and its components significantly with an increase of 27% in grain yield; significant increase in grain yield was also recorded along with simultaneous increase in plant densities. Therefore, it can be said that ridge sowing with high plant density practice in late sown pigeonpea produces maximum grain yield.	0	WOS:000207874000018	5	Pigeonpea; Ridge; Planting methods; Plant populations; Harvest index	NONE	Mishra, Akhilesh; Prasad, Kedar; Swarnkar, G.

Millsp.) has remained low on the farmers' fields in Southern Guinea Savanna agro-ecological environment of Nigeria, despite its agronomic potentials. In 2002 - 2004, twenty-nine improved pigeon pea genotypes from ICRISAT were evaluated along with a local check for grain yield and other agronomic characteristics with a view to further enhance pigeon pea productivity in the region. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with three replications located at the National Root Crops Research Institute sub-station, Otobi (07 degrees 10' N, 08 degrees 39'. E, elevation 105.1 m), Benue State, Nigeria. All pigeon pea genotypes, including the local check, produced dry grain yield above 1.00 t/ha with a mean of 1.37 t/ha except ICP 00053. ICP 7343, ICP 7992 (both medium duration), ICP 12746, ICP 7991 and ICP 7186 (long duration) pigeon pea genotypes proved superior to the local check in number of pods produced per plant, dry pod weight and grain yield. However, when farmers' preferences for early-maturing and high-yielding genotypes are considered, ICP 6971 and ICP 88039 may be chosen.

Vegetable crops viz cowpea, okra and bottle gourd, maize for grain, long duration pigeon pea, sweet basil in first year at their full and half population were intercropped with full population of safed musli in additive series. In the second year okra and sweet basil were replaced by lablab bean and sacred basil, respectively. Results of two years' experiments showed that intercropping of pigeon pea and bottle gourd with musli were advantageous in terms of overall yield, land equivalent ratio (LER), monetary advantage and economic return. The most appropriate combinations to realize the maximum advantage from intercropping were half plant population of bottle gourd grown at 100 x 100 cm or 120 x 90 cm spacing and pigeon pea grown at 120 x 20 cm spacing with musli. These combinations gave additional yield of 49.82 t ha(-1) of bottle gourd and 6.51 t ha(-1) grain of pigeon pea (2-year mean) without significantly reducing the root yield of musli.	3	WOS:000300149300008	12	NONE	NONE	Singh, Man; Singh, Aparbal; Singh, Saudan; Tripathi, R.

The main objective of the study was to enhance the crop productivity on ravinous land with different on farm activities based on rain water management. Twenty five check dams were constructed earlier in the entire project area on down stream of nalas. The catchment area of these nalas bunds is about 200 ha and 20 hectometer surface water is arrested in these check dams every year, which was exploited for irrigation on 190 ha land. The mini earthen store reservoir in the form of contour bunds, submergence bunds, water harvesting bundhies, land levelling & smoothening and vegetative barrier, which were earlier formed also help in harvesting the maximum rain water under dry environment. The arrested rain water and run off control have helped in improvement of ground water table, which has risen to the extent of 3.85 m over the base year. The cropping systems followed in catchments area of check dams gave system productivity as 47.94 q/ha in sesamum-pea, 42.00 q/ha in sesamum-gram, 37.52 q/ha in sesamum-mustard and 72.48 q/ha in black gram-wheat, which was higher over the farmers practices. The cultivation on contour alignment gave system productivity of sesamum-pea by 37.41 q/ha, sesamum-gram by 34.86 q/ha, sesamum-mustard by 32.89 q/ha and black gram-wheat by 54.28 q/ha. The long duration pigeon pea raised in submergence bunding gave yield of 22.00 q/ha, which was higher over farmers practices (19.50 q/ha). The cabbage and tomato yielded 255.00 q/ha and 242.00 q/ha, respectively, irrigated with recycled water in well from the water harvesting demonstration, conducted under 'Farmers Participatory Action Research programme on Water/Rain Water Harvesting'. The grain yield of pigeon pea harvested was 21.00 q/ha from the leveled field, which was higher by a margin of 1.50 q/ha or 7.70 % over farmers practices. The black gram and wheat yielded 8.50 q/ha and 47.85 q/ha, respectively, from the cropping system of black gram - wheat followed under this soil and water conservation measures.	0	WOS:000281547600013	5	Arrested water; Bundelkhand; On farm activities; Participatory research; Ravines; Shallow tube well	NONE	Singh, R.

The study evaluated six cropping systems: (1) continuous sole maize, (2) maize rotated with short-duration legume, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.), (3) maize rotated with long-duration legume, pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.), (4) maize intercropped with pigeonpea (5) hedgerow intercropping of maize and a perennial legume, gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), and (6) continuous sole maize, green-manured with gliricidia prunings produced from an equivalent area outside the cropped field ('biomass transfer technology'). Maize-cowpea sequential and pigeonpea/maize intercropping systems produced, respectively, 17 and 24% higher maize yields than continuous sole maize, but maize-pigeonpea rotation yielded only marginally better. Hedgerow intercropping did not increase maize yields because increased yields during the few high rainfall seasons did not compensate the yield losses in other seasons due to the competition of hedgerows for water with crop. Green manuring with gliricidia prunings increased maize production by 27%, but this technology was not economical because of high labour costs for production and application of prunings to the crop. The annual grain legume-based cropping systems were 32-49% more profitable than continuous sole maize, making them attractive to small farmers in semi-arid tropics. Both cowpea and pigeonpea were affected by pests and diseases, which indicated the need for integrated pest management for realising the potential benefits of these legume-based systems.

INT CROPS RES INST SEMI ARID TROP, Nairobi, Kenya	NONE	ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR SMALLHOLDER SEED SUPPLY	Farmer-to-farmer seed supply: Case study of pigeonpea seed distribution in Kenya	NONE	In the semi-arid Makueni district in Kenya, smallholder farmers traditionally intercrop their staple cereal with long-duration pigeonpea. Short-duration pigeonpea varieties developed by ICRISAT and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute can give high yields and escape drought, but require non-traditional management practices (e.g., sole-cropping, spraying against insect pests). Field day demonstrations generated considerable interest in these short-duration varieties, particularly among groups of women farmers. A woman farmer who had successfully grown the new varieties, and was a member of a women's group herself started to multiply and sell seed. She distributed some seed free, as a promotional effort, and provided free agronomic advice to all customers. Adoption of short-duration pigeonpea in the region has been encouraging. Demand for seed is increasing, as a result of these promotional efforts and efforts by ICRISAT to introduce and popularize improved pigeonpea processing and utilization techniques.	0	WOS:000072625100023	0	NONE	NONE	Muli, JM; Omanga, PA; Jones, RB	1997	TS=("long duration" NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

However, its productivity, which hovers around 700 kg ha(-1), has remained stagnant over the past several decades. Local landraces dominate the cultivation of pigeonpea in the country. A major reason for low productivity in pigeonpea is the nonavailability of quality seed of improved varieties to farmers. In this article, we share experiences of farmer-participatory pigeonpea seed production in Fatehpur and Kanpur Dehat districts in Uttar Pradesh in India. Through farmer-participatory varietal selection trials, farmers identified NA 1, long-duration pigeonpea variety and UPAS 120, short-duration variety, as their preferred choices. Long-duration variety NA 1 was preferred because of its disease resistance, higher yield, attractive seed size and color. Farmers were organized to form cooperative societies to undertake seed production, processing and marketing at the local level. Societies were also linked with the public sector seed producing agencies to participate in the formal seed production program. The C: B ratio of seed production of NA 1 variety was 1: 5.19 as compared to 1: 2.53 of the local variety. Village-level seed production not only addressed the issue of shortage of quality seeds but also brought higher incomes to farmers leading to improved livelihood.	0	WOS:000324654600003	19	participatory approach; linkages; seed delivery; farmer association; seed marketing	VARIETAL SELECTION; CROP IMPROVEMENT	Singh, S.

Millsp.) is the second important pulse crop in India. Pod fly [Melanagromyza obtusa (Malloch)] is a major pest of long-duration pigeonpea in India. The grain damage caused by this insect pest varies from 20 to 80%. The concealed mode of life of pod fly within the pod makes it difficult to control, with chemical insecticides. Therefore, host-plant resistance is an important tool for the management of this pest. Analysis of pod walls of five pod fly resistant/tolerant and six susceptible cultivars/genotypes showed that the genotypes with more wax, total phenols and less reducing and non-reducing sugars and total amino acids suffered less pod and grain damage by pod fly. Therefore, these biochemical pod traits can be used as marker to identify the resistance sources to be used in breeding programme.	0	WOS:000297491600013	9	Melanagromyza obtusa; Phenols; Pigeonpea; Reducing sugar; Wax	RESISTANCE	Pandey, Vageesh; Srivastava, C.

Genotypic variation in yield within a production environment was found to vary in relation to changes in harvest index and across environment (irrigation, seasons) due to variation in total dry matter production. A lack of negative relationship between the total dry matter and harvest index suggests the possibility of optimizing both for obtaining higher yield from long-duration genotypes.	1	WOS:000168678400004	17	NONE	WATER-USE	Rao, JVBKK; Johansen, C; Chauhan, YS; Chauhan, YS; Jain, VK; Jain, KC; Talwar, HS	2001	TS=("long duration" NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

The consistency in the reaction (resistant to moderately resistant) to wilt disease indicated that genotypes IPA 16 F, IPA 8 F, IPA 9 F and IPA 12 F are very good source of resistance to all the five variants of Fusarium udum prevalent in India causing wilt and can be used as resistant donors in pigeonpea wilt resistance breeding programme.	0	WOS:000297491600011	7	Cajanus cajan; Fusarium udum; Resistant donor; Wilt	NONE	Singh, Farindra; Singh, I.

Results revealed that ridge planting method influnced the seed yield and its components significantly with an increase of 27% in grain yield; significant increase in grain yield was also recorded along with simultaneous increase in plant densities. Therefore, it can be said that ridge sowing with high plant density practice in late sown pigeonpea produces maximum grain yield.	0	WOS:000207874000018	5	Pigeonpea; Ridge; Planting methods; Plant populations; Harvest index	NONE	Mishra, Akhilesh; Prasad, Kedar; Swarnkar, G.

Tolerant varieties could be an inexpensive and biologically smart technology that improves soils while minimizing fertilizer costs. Yet other technologies that improve productivity and appear to be biologically sound have been rejected by farmers. To translate benefits to smallholder farmers, research on low-nutrient tolerant genes and crop improvement must keep farmer preferences and belief systems in the forefront. We review farmer participatory research on legume-intensification and soil fertility management options for smallholder farmers in Africa, including recent results from our work in Malawi and Kenya. We suggest that indeterminate, long-duration legumes are the best bet for producing high quality residues, compared to short-duration and determinate genotypes. This may be due to a long period of time to biologically fix nitrogen, acquire nutrients, photosynthesize and grain fill. Also, the indeterminate nature of long-duration varieties facilitates recovery from intermittent stresses such as drought or pest pressure. However, indeterminate growth habit is also associated with late maturity, moderate yield potential and high labour demand. These traits are not necessarily compatible with smallholder criteria for acceptable varieties. Malawi women farmers, for example, prioritized early maturity and low-labour requirement, as well as yield potential. To address complex farmer requirements, we suggest the purposeful combination of species with different growth habits; e. g. deep-rooted indeterminate long-duration pigeonpea interplanted with short-duration soyabean and groudnut varieties. On-farm trials in Malawi indicate that calorie production can be increased by 30% through pigeonpea-intensified systems. Farmers consistently indicate strong interest in these systems. In Kenya, a 55% yield increase was observed for a doubled-up pigeonpea system (a double row of pigeonpea intercropped with three maize rows) compared to traditional, low density intercrops. However, the need for improved pigeonpea varieties with high intercrop suitability, including reduced early branching, was highlighted by a farmer preference study in the same area. These examples illustrate the potential for participatory research methodologies to drive biophysical research in farmer-acceptable directions.	22	WOS:000178551000017	28	NONE	MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; SYSTEMS; MALAWI	Snapp, SS; Silim, SN	2002	TS=("long duration" NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

Perennial grain crops could potentially ameliorate the land degradation and off-site impacts associated with annual grain cropping. However, herbaceous perennial plants with constitutively high allocation to harvestable seeds are rare to absent in nature. Recent trade-off theory models suggest that rugged fitness landscapes may explain the absence of this form better than sink competition models. Artificial selection for both grain production and multiyear lifespan can lead to more rapid progress in the face of fitness and genetic trade-offs than natural selection but is likely to result in plant types that differ substantially from all current domestic crops. Perennial grain domestication is also likely to require the development of selection strategies that differ from published crop breeding methods, despite their success in improving long-domesticated crops; for this purpose, we have reviewed literature in the areas of population and evolutionary genetics, domestication, and molecular biology. Rapid domestication will likely require genes with large effect that are expected to exhibit strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Cryptic genetic variation will need to be deliberately exposed both to purge mildly deleterious alleles and to generate novel agronomic phenotypes. We predict that perennial grain domestication programs will benefit from population subdivision followed by selection for simple traits in each subpopulation, the evaluation of very large populations, high selection intensity, rapid cycling through generations, and heterosis. The latter may be particularly beneficial in the development of varieties with stable yield and tolerance to crowding.	1	WOS:000344010400020	191	bottleneck; domestication; epigenetics; epistasis; evolvability; genetic assimilation; genetic load; perennial grain; pleiotropy; trade-off	CRYPTIC GENETIC-VARIATION; ELITE RICE HYBRID; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; IMPROVED POPULATIONS; MAIZE DOMESTICATION; DNA METHYLATION; LIFE-HISTORY; SUNFLOWER DOMESTICATION; EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE	DeHaan, Lee R.; Van Tassel, David L.	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

The investigation was based on field experiments conducted at two sites characterized by marginal environmental conditions in south-west Germany in 1999 and 2000. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale x Secale montanum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus) and linseed (Linum perenne). In some stands, white clover (Trifolium repens) was included as an undersown intercrop for improved N supply. It was found that maturation of the species differed by up to almost 6 weeks, and consequently the threshability of most mixed stands was not satisfactory. Nevertheless, mixtures of either of the grasses (rye or wheatgrass) with lupin or undersown clover proved to be more suitable than pure stands in most cases, for measures such as grain yield, weed suppression and stability of grain yield over years. The grain yield harvested in the experiments in 1999 was low, reaching about 2.7 t ha(-1) with rye, and decreased for most species in 2000. If improved genotypes were available, perennial grain crops could provide an alternative for arable cropping and set-aside areas under marginal conditions.	9	WOS:000178484100006	15	grain yield; mixed stands; perennial grain crops	NITROGEN TRANSFER	Weik, L; Kaul, HP; Kubler, E; Aufhammer, W	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

In contrast, monocultures of annual crops are sown on more than two-thirds of global cropland. Grain and oilseed crops are the foundation of the human diet, but to date there are no perennial species that produce adequate grain harvests. Yet perennial plant communities store more carbon, maintain better soil and water quality, and manage nutrients more conservatively than do annual plant communities, and they have greater biomass and resource management capacity. These advantages provide a base from which to begin hybridization and selection for increased resource allocation to developing seeds, a decades-long process that must overcome or circumvent genetic complications. Breeding programs aimed at developing perennial grain crops have been initiated in wheat, sorghum, sunflower, intermediate wheatgrass, and other species.	60	WOS:000239610900007	52	crop domestication; interspecific hybridization; perennial grain; plant breeding; sustainable agriculture	INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; SEED YIELD; SORGHUM; POPULATIONS; ALFALFA; AGRICULTURE; ACCESSIONS; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; ECOLOGY	Cox, Thomas S.; Glover, Jerry D.; Van Tassel, David L.; Cox, Cindy M.; DeHaan, Lee R.	2006	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Doubts about the possibility of perennial grain crops rest upon two assumptions: (1) that the relationship between yield and longevity is a fixed function that cannot be influenced by selection, mutation or environmental changes; and (2) that yield and longevity trade off in a bivariate manner to the exclusion of all other traits. These assumptions are consistent with the phenotypic trade-off model, but recent research suggests that a quantitative genetic model is a more appropriate approach to trade-offs. In the quantitative genetic model, environmental and genetic changes can result in increases in two traits simultaneously even when a trade-off, or negative correlation, exists between the two traits. Empirical evidence that the trade-off between perenniality and reproductive allocation is not fixed comes from wild, herbaceous perennials that can produce more than 2000 kg seed ha(-1) in the temperate zone, and herbaceous perennial crops that produce on average 8900 kg fruit ha(-1) in the tropics. Ecological literature suggests that most perennials produce small amounts of seed relative to their vegetative growth not as a physiological absolute, but rather as a result of natural selection in a stable, competitive environment favoring longevity. By selecting strongly for seed yield in a population of perennial plants, the plant breeder can likely achieve that which is rare in nature-a high seed-yielding perennial plant. The same general methodologies that have allowed annual grain breeders to increase grain yield and push many combinations of negatively correlated traits to levels of expression not seen in nature are available to the perennial grain breeder. Perennial,rain breeders are integrating ecological principles and traditional plant breeding methods in their efforts to develop perennial grain wheat (Triticum spp.), sorghum (Sorghum spp.), sunflower (Helianthus spp.), Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis) and rice (Oryza spp.).	40	WOS:000229467200004	39	trade-off. carbon allocation; perenniality; life history; plant domestication	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; RECURRENT SELECTION; FORAGE QUALITY; TRADE-OFFS; SEED YIELD; EVOLUTION; WHEAT; PLASTICITY; ALFALFA; TRAITS	DeHaan, LR; Van Tassel, DL; Cox, TS	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Since it is likely that these systems will be rotated with other agronomic crops, a better understanding of how rapidly perennial grain systems improve local ecosystem services is needed. We quantified soil moisture, lysimeter NO3 leaching, soil labile C accrual, and grain yields in the first 2 yr of a perennial grain crop under development [kernza wheatgrass, Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey] relative to annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under three management systems. Overall, differences between annual and perennial plants were much greater than differences observed due to management. In the second year, perennial kernza reduced soil moisture at lower depths and reduced total NO3 leaching (by 86% or more) relative to annual wheat, indicating that perennial roots actively used more available soil water and captured more applied fertilizer than annual roots. Carbon mineralization rates beneath kernza during the second year were increased 13% compared with annual wheat. First-year kernza grain yields were 4.5% of annual wheat, but second year yields increased to 33% of wheat with a harvest index of 0.10. Although current yields are modest, the realized ecosystem services associated with this developing crop are promising and are a compelling reason to continue breeding efforts for higher yields and for use as a multipurpose crop (e.g., grain, forage, and biofuel).	3	WOS:000318537300023	69	NONE	CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM; INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; CENTRAL ILLINOIS; SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; CROPPING SYSTEM; CEREAL CROPS; MIXED STANDS; SEED YIELDS; CARBON	Culman, Steve W.; Snapp, Sieglinde S.; Ollenburger, Mary; Basso, Bruno; DeHaan, Lee R.	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Typical cultural practices effective at reducing soil- and residue-borne pathogens, such as annual crop rotations, delayed fall planting, and tillage, are not feasible in perennial systems. Consequently, soil- and residue-borne pathogens, and pathogens such as root colonizers and viruses that survive in live tissue, may increase in importance in a perennial grain crop. Resistance genes will undeniably be important defenses against disease. However, it is seldom, if ever, possible to incorporate within a single cultivar resistance to all existing and future important diseases. Furthermore. genes vulnerable to 'boom and bust' cycles are generally short-lived when deployed in monocultures. For these reasons, the use of mixtures of crop cultivars or species that vary in resistance functions will likely be an important strategy for managing diseases and pests of perennial grains. Burning of plant residue, a natural phenomenon in native perennial grass systems, may also be an effective disease management strategy. The successful implementation of these management tools may reduce or eliminate the risk that perennial grain crops will become pathogen refugia that affect neighboring annual plantings and the productivity of perennial plants.	13	WOS:000229467200005	75	perennial wheat; host diversity; mixtures; blends; polyculture; resistance; burning	WHEAT CULTIVAR MIXTURES; WINTER-WHEAT; CEPHALOSPORIUM STRIPE; PLANT-PATHOGENS; MOSAIC-VIRUS; LEAF RUST; STEM ROT; TAN SPOT; DIVERSITY; RESISTANCE	Cox, CM; Garrett, KA; Bockus, WW	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

With population growth and environmental deterioration, the attention about food security and sustainable agriculture is on the increase, and the status of ecological agriculture comes into prominence. Perennial grain crops would address many agricultural problems as well as substantial ecological and economic benefits, which can provide multiple ecosystem services essential for sustainable production more effectively than production systems based on annual crops, such as protecting against soil erosion, conserving water and nutrients, storing more carbon below ground, and building better pest tolerance.

The concept of perennial grain production is not new.  Historically, seeds of perennial grasses have been used as grain by various human cultures.  In this paper, efforts to develop perennial grain crops which were initiated during the 20th century are discussed.  These include attempts by the Soviets and Europeans to perennialize annual grains such as wheat and rye.  More recently, efforts in the U.S. inspired by the publication of Dr. Wes Jackson's book, New Roots for Agriculture,1,2 have focused upon the domestication of perennial grass species.  The advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches to perennial grain development are discussed.  Specific examples are given with the hope that future efforts can benefit from experiences of the past and present.	31	WOS:A1990EQ08500002	287	NONE	TRIPSACUM-DACTYLOIDES GRAMINEAE; DISTICHLIS-PALMERI GRAIN; EASTERN GAMAGRASS; LOLIUM-PERENNE; SOIL-EROSION; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; PURE STANDS; DRY-MATTER; SPRING RYE; AGRICULTURE	WAGONER, P	1990	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

A study was conducted for the investigation of the persistence, the dry matter accumulation potential and the competitive ability of perennial grain crops in different mixtures on marginal lands. Factorial field experiments were conducted at two sites with marginal environmental conditions in south-west Germany. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum Guss.), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium Host.), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.) and linseed (Linum perenne L.). In some stands white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was included as an undersown intercrop for improved nitrogen supply. Intermediate wheatgrass and lupine demonstrated the best persistence among the examined species. Rye showed a satisfactory ability to persist only when grown in mixture with legumes. Apparently the persistence of rye was influenced positively from nitrogen fixed by the legumes. Linseed showed only on one location a small ability for perennialism, while on the other location it did not persist at all. Both grass species were in most cases stronger competitors than the companion species. In various mixtures a positive effect of legumes on the growth of the grass species was evident. Therefore even using grain crop mixtures of grasses and legumes seem to be promising for marginal lands. Since species' competitive ability depends to a large extent on the site, statements about the suitability of different species for growing together in mixtures are not generally possible, but only with reference to a specific site.	0	WOS:000178004800006	23	NONE	NITROGEN TRANSFER	Weik, L; Kaul, HP; Kubler, E; Aufhammer, W	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Resistance to multiple pathogens, therefore, will clearly be important in disease management. The objective of this research was to evaluate disease resistance in 10 perennial grain accessions (one to two accessions of each: perennial wheat (Thinopyrum sp. x Triticum aestivum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), perennial rye (Secale montanum), hexaploid triticale (Triticum turgidum x S. montanum), octoploid triticale (Triticum aestivum x S. montanum), tetraploid perennial rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum), and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum)) to tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), take-all (caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), wheat streak mosaic, and barley yellow dwarf, four important diseases of the Great Plains. Several of the grasses were resistant to tan spot, barley yellow dwarf, and wheat streak mosaic. Indeed, the wild grasses and perennial donors T. intermedium (including BFPMC1), T ponticum, and S. montanum, in addition to Permontra. a tetraploid perennial rye, were highly resistant to all three diseases. Additionally, the remaining grasses tested were also more resistant to tan spot than the susceptible wheat control. However. none of the 10 grass accessions appeared highly resistant to take-all, and substantial losses in biomass were observed, although such effects may be moderated under field conditions due to the potential for take-all decline in perennial plantings.	12	WOS:000232857600016	45	NONE	MOSAIC-VIRUS RESISTANCE; CULTIVAR MIXTURES; AGROPYRON INTERMEDIUM; DISEASE RESISTANCE; TAN SPOT; WHEAT; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; CROPS; SYSTEMS	Cox, CM; Garrett, KA; Cox, TS; Bockus, WW; Peters, T	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

It has been identified as a potential perennial grain legume. To describe variation among natural populations for agriculturally desirable characteristics, 141 accessions of D. illinoensis and one of D. leptolobus were evaluated in common garden plantings established in 1988 and 1990. Characteristics showing diversity among populations included seed yield, plant height, growth habit, days to maturity, 100 seed weight, and shatter resistance. Eight characteristics were analyzed by principal components and cluster analysis. The resulting four clusters accounted for 56% of the variation among accessions. One cluster was distinctive in having plants with vigorous, prostrate first year growth, poor winter hardiness, and large seed. Three accessions also had indehiscent legumes useful for breeding shatter resistance. There appears to be sufficient variation to support genetic improvement of agricultural characteristics of Illinois bundleflower.	6	WOS:000082791800002	20	genetic resources; legumes; perennial grains; new crops	NONE	Kulakow, PA	1999	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

The persistent problem of worldwide soil erosion has rekindled interest in perennial grain crops. All of our current grain crops are annuals; therefore, developing an array of new perennial grains - grasses, legumes, and others - will require a long-term commitment. Fortunately, many perennial species can be hybridized with related annual crops, allowing us to incorporate genes of domestication much more quickly than did our ancestors who first selected the genes. Some grain crops - including rye, rice, and sorghum - can be hybridized with close perennial relatives to establish new gene pools. Others, such as wheat, oat, maize, soybean, and sunflower, must be hybridized with more distantly related perennial species and genera. Finally, some perennial species with relatively high grain yields - intermediate wheatgrass, wildrye, lymegrass, eastern gamagrass, Indian ricegrass, Illinois bundleflower, Maximilian sunflower, and probably others - are candidates for direct domestication without interspecific hybridization. To ensure diversity in the field and foster further genetic improvement, breeders will need to develop deep gene pools for each crop. Discussions of breeding strategies for perennial grains have concentrated on allocation of photosynthetic resources between seeds and vegetative structures. However, perennials will likely be grown in more diverse agro-ecosystems and require arrays of traits very different from those usually addressed by breeders of annuals. The only way to address concerns about the feasibility of perennial grains is to carry out breeding programs with adequate resources on a sufficient time scale. A massive program for breeding perennial grains could be funded by diversion of a relatively small fraction of the world's agricultural research budget.	59	WOS:000174854200001	199	natural systems agriculture; interspecific hybridization; crop domestication; cereal; legume	HALEPENSE L PERS; ZEA-DIPLOPERENNIS POACEAE; WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; SECALE-CEREALE L; DACTYLOIDES L L; TRIPSACUM-DACTYLOIDES; EASTERN GAMAGRASS; INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION; INTERGENERIC HYBRIDS; WIDE HYBRIDIZATION	Cox, TS; Bender, M; Picone, C; Van Tassel, DL; Holland, JB; Brummer, EC; Zoeller, BE; Paterson, AH; Jackson, W	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Perennial grain crops offer a new solution to the long-standing problems of salinity and soil erosion associated with conventional cropping systems based on annual plants.; Seed yield and its components (culm number, spikelet number per culm, seed set, seed weight) were measured in 46 accessions of Microlaena stipoides (microlaena, meadow or weeping rice grass) from Western Australia and New South Wales to quantify potentially useful variation in the species.; A high degree of variability was found to exist, with a 20-fold range in seed yield (0.1-2.4 g/plant), 5-fold range in seed weight (129-666 mg per 100 seeds), 2-fold range in spikelet number (14-30 per culm), 8-fold range in seed set (12-98%), and a 5-fold range in culm number (11-59 per plant). Seed yield was positively and significantly (P<0.05) correlated with culm number, seed set, and seed weight (r>0.55 for all). No correlation was found between seed yield and spikelet number per culm (r=-0.14).; The range in seed yield and its components suggests that there is sufficient variation within microlaena to make selections for higher yielding lines.

In mixed stands, besides intraspecific competition for the available growth factors also interspecific competition appears. This study was conducted to characterize and quantify effects of interspecific competition on dry matter production in exemplary stands of perennials applying different static and dynamic parameters. The parameters were compared on the basis of data from field experiments conducted at two sites in south-west Germany. The experiments included perennial species of rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum), lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus) and linseed (Linum perenne) in pure stands and in two component mixtures. The relative yield total (RYT) was found to be a suitable static indicator of resource complementarity. Competitive ability was appropriately described by the competitive balance index (C-h). Regression models derived from Lotka-Volterra equations rendered a good description of dynamic growth and competition. Occasionally rye showed still an increase of dry matter at the end of the sampling period in late summer, which led to wrong estimations of competition coefficients.	1	WOS:000171008900008	26	NONE	MIXTURES; DENSITY; GROWTH; YIELD	Weik, L; Kaul, HP; Aufhammer, W	2001	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Currently annual grains dominate grain production. Perennial grains offer many important opportunities to produce grains in a more environmentally, economically, and energetically sound manner. Thus, major research efforts are needed to develop perennial grains to help feed the growing and malnourished world population. These grains would also aid in diversifying agriculture.

Nipa was a wild harvest staple of the Cocopah people of the Rio Colorado delta. We investigated the physiology, anatomy, chromosome number, and agronomic potential of nipa as a global food crop. Nipa seeds had 60-93% germination on salinities ranging from 0 to 30 gL(-1). Relative Growth Rates (RGR) on both flooded and aerobic conditions remained above 4% d(-1) up to 30 gL(-1), about half the RGR on freshwater. Nipa grain (caryopses) had 7-8% protein, 8% sugar and 79% total digestible carbohydrates (mostly starch) and only 2% ash and 8% fiber, equal to conventional grains in apparent nutritional value. Shoots were low in ash and sodium, and compared favorably to alfalfa forage in protein, digestible carbohydrates and energy contents. Mature female stands in the Colorado River delta produced an estimated 1.25 tha(-1) of grain, but over two years in the greenhouse only partial flowering was observed. Nevertheless, D. palmeri appears to be worth developing as a perennial grain and forage crop, especially for salinized, flooded soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

All five grains contain starch granules and protein in the starchy endosperm. Protein bodies, which often contain phytin inclusions, are abundant in the aleurone and embryo. Lipid deposits are primarily located in the embryo and aleurone. Caryopses of A. intermedium, A. trichophorum, S. montanum, and H. bulbosum are similar morphologically, having two populations of starch granules as well as continuous protein matrix in starchy endosperm tissue. The aleurone of Agropyron spp., T dactyloides, and S. montanum are single celled in thickness. H. bulbosum has a multiple-layered aleurone (usually three cells thick). The caryopsis of T. dactyloides is nearly spherical, and the starchy endosperm contains spherical starch granules embedded in a matrix of small protein bodies.

Because of the tendency for grain yield fluctuations caused by water stress, however, claypan soils may have potential for conversion from grain to grass production in support of biomass energy markets and conservation programs. This study examined the economic potential of transitioning from grain to perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production on claypan soils using comparative breakeven analysis. Partial budgets for a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation and a perennial switchgrass cropping system were developed. Yield data from research plots with varying topsoil depths defined by the underlying claypan layer were used to establish yield expectations as affected by topsoil depth. Switchgrass yield projections for the claypan region were simulated with the Agricultural Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) model. Comparative breakeven prices for two switchgrass cultivars ranged from US$65 on marginal, eroded soils to US$124 Mg-1 on soils with >27 cm of topsoil. Breakeven yields with a biomass price of US$40 Mg-1 would require yield increases of up to 450% for lower yielding cultivars. The switchgrass cultivar Kanlow holds the most promise for biomass production on claypan soils; with an average projected yield of 12.56 Mg ha(-1), breakeven prices fall to around US$60-80 Mg-1 for marginal soils with <15 cm of topsoil. Based on these projections, perennial switchgrass shows potential to compete with conventional grain crops at reasonable yield levels on eroded soils in the Central Claypan region.	2	WOS:000304233600010	40	NONE	ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; YIELD; CORN; BIOENERGY; BIOFUELS; RUNOFF; ENERGY; MODEL	Landers, Greg W.; Thompson, Allen L.; Kitchen, Newell R.; Massey, Ray E.	2012	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

In addition, this manuscript addresses prospects for future development by means of agroforestry, biochar application, and perennial grain crops, aimed at maintaining sustainability of agroecosystems, restoring degraded croplands, and increasing the SOC sink capacity.

Food security for the poor depends on an adequate supply of food and/or the ability to purchase food. Unfortunately in the world today, more than 3.7 billion people are malnourished because of shortages of calories, protein, several vitamins, iron and iodine (World Health Organization, 2005; Rhodes, 2005). People can die because of shortage of any one of these nutrients or a combination of them. The total of 3.7 billion malnourished people is the largest number ever in history.; In the world today, there are more than 6.5 billion humans (PRB, 2006). Based on current rates of increase, the world population is projected to double to more than 13 billion in about 58 years (PRB, 2006). At a time when the world population continues to expand at a rate of 1.2% per year, adding more than a quarter million people daily, providing adequate food becomes an increasingly difficult problem. Conceivably, the numbers of the malnourished will reach 5 billion in a few decades. Reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the US Department of Agriculture, as well as numerous other international organizations, further confirm the serious nature of the global food supply. For example, the per capita availability of world cereal grains, which make up 80% of the world's food supply, has been declining for more than two decades. This decline is taking place despite all the current agricultural and biotechnological facilities available.; Malnourished people are more susceptible to numerous diseases, like malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and AIDS. The World Health Organization reports that there are more than 2.4 billion people infected with malaria, 2 billion infected with tuberculosis, 600 million infected with schistosomiasis and 40 million infected with AIDS (Pimentel et al., 2004).; In this chapter, we will examine the need to increase and make more rational food production, to conserve natural resources, to reduce food (crop) losses to pests, to consider the possibility and benefits of converting annual grains into perennial grains and to consider new crops and innovative minilivestock.	0	WOS:000293121000004	71	Genetically engineered crops; environment; pesticides; annual grain; minilivestock; perennial grain; food diversity; world food security	CORN; SUSTAINABILITY; EROSION	Pimentel, D.; Paoletti, M.

Perennial crops could also provide economically viable cropping option to farmers. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) is an ideal crop for perennialization because of existing genetic resources and a wide variety of end-uses. The objective of this research was to evaluate interspecific hybrids between perennial Helianthus tuberosus L (2n = 6x = 102) and annual H. annuus L (2n = 2x = 34) for perenniality and agronomic traits; assessing their utility in developing a perennial seed crop. Field trials indicated that seed yield traits were positively correlated with head traits. Tuber traits, which are required for perenniality, and seed yield traits were not correlated, indicating that simultaneous selection may be able to target high yielding lines that also tuberize. The F-1 individuals were intermated for one generation and the intermated F-1 (IM1F1) showed increases in head size (up to 20%) compared to the best F-1 individual. The lack of correlation between tuber and seed traits coupled with phenotypic improvement after one generation of intermating suggest that the best improvement strategy for perennial sunflower is a recurrent selection program focusing on yield.

NONE	In the course of their evolution, the angiosperms have radiated into most known plant forms and life histories. Their adaptation to a recently created habitat, the crop field, produced a novel form: the plant that allocates an unprecedented 30-60% of its net productivity to sexual structures. Long-lived trees, shrubs and vines of this form evolved, as did annual herbs. Perennial herb forms with increased allocation to asexual reproduction evolved, but there are no examples of perennial herbs with high sexual effort. We suggest that sowing seed into annually tilled fields favored shorter-lived herbs because of trade-offs between first-year seed production and relative growth rate and/or persistence. By propagating cuttings, people quickly domesticated tuber crops and large woody plants. Perennial herbs were too small to be efficiently propagated by cuttings, and the association between longevity, allogamy and genetic load made rapid domestication by sexual cycles unlikely. Perennial grain crops do not exist because they could not have evolved under the original set of conditions; however, they can be deliberately developed today through artificial phenotypic and genotypic selection.	14	WOS:000281311700004	142	domestication; life form; lifespan; new crops; perennial grains; reproductive effort	PERENNIAL-GRAIN CROPS; DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; BETA SPECIES COMPLEX; GENETIC LOAD; LOLIUM-PERENNE; LIFE-HISTORY; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; HIGHBUSH BLUEBERRY; FERTILE CRESCENT	Van Tassel, David L.; DeHaan, Lee R.; Cox, Thomas S.	2010	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

One approach involves the development of a perennial grain sorghum by crossing tetraploid Sorghum bicolor with wild S. halepense to combine high seed yield with overwintering ability via rhizome production. We grew tetraploid S. bicolor, F-1 hybrid (BC0), and two backcross generations (BC, and BC,) in a randomized block design to examine total biomass, seed yield, and allocation to plant parts within and across generations. Root, rhizome, stem and leaf, and total biomass decreased from the BC, to BC, to S. bicolor generations, whereas panicle mass, seed mass, and reproductive allocation were lowest in the BC0 generation (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Mean seed mass (g.plant(-1)) was 39.1 in the BC0, 107.3 in the BC1, 84.1 in the BC2, and 92.7 for the S. bicolor parent, which translated into yields of 171.9, 471.6, 396.7, and 407.5 g.m(-2), respectively. Reproductive allocation varied from 14.7% in BC0 to 28.9% in BC2 compared with 33.5% in S. bicolor. Mean allocation to rhizomes was 2.71% in BC0 but negligible in BC1 and BC2. There was no relationship between rhizome mass and seed mass within any generation, but there was a positive correlation between total plant mass and rhizome mass in BC0. We divided the BC0 population into four groups with respect to rhizome production and found no significant differences among the groups in plant size or seed yield. Within each generation, reproductive allocation was inversely related to culm mass. The lack of an apparent trade-off between allocation to rhizome versus allocation to seed within any generation supports the possibility of combining within a population high seed yield and production of perennating belowground organs.	25	WOS:A1994NN38200008	39	BACKCROSS; HYBRID; PERENNIAL GRAINS; REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION; RHIZOME; SEED MASS; SORGHUM BICOLOR; SORGHUM HALEPENSE	REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; L PERS; JOHNSON GRASS; LIFE-HISTORY; SIZE; POPULATION; PLANTS; COSTS; BIOLOGY; GROWTH	PIPER, JK; KULAKOW, PA	1994	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

There were significant effects of site, treatment, and year on both aboveground biomass and seed yield. On average, bundleflower monoculture produced the greatest aboveground biomass, although the three-species mixture produced the peak biomass (814 g/m(2)) in any given year. Among treatments, Illinois bundleflower monoculture yielded the most seed (maximum = 122 g/m(2)). Overall, biomass and seed yield were higher at the more fertile Site 1, but species differed in their dependence on soil fertility. Among species, bundleflower performed fairly independently of soil fertility, wildrye grew poorly on the less fertile soil, and gamagrass persisted at both sites although it grew less well at Site 2,. In most cases, mixtures produced as well as the best-yielding monoculture. In 26 of 30 instances, biomass relative yield totals (RYTs) were statistically > 1.0 and, in 19 of 21 cases, RYT for seed yield was statistically > 1.0. In general, the overyielding effect appeared stronger at Site 2 than at Site 1, with seed yield RYT appearing to increase with time at Site 2. The results show that the seed yield of perennials can be high, and that some species can persist in mixture for several years. The data for 5 yrs point to the need to follow long-term patterns of yield and interspecific interactions within perennial grain polycultures in order to maintain species diversity and to make reasonable predictions.

From mid-June to early August A. flavokansiensis feeds on young leaves and inflorescences of D. llinoensis. At high density, A. flavokansiensis potentially reduces seed yield and is thus an important consideration for long-term stands that are to be grown without insecticides. The potential to manage this insect via intercropping its host species with other, non-host perennial species by monitoring A. flavokansiensis density on D. illinoensis within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with Tripsacum dactyloides, and three-species mixtures with T. dactyloides and Leymus racemosus was examined. Insects were censused 2-3 times weekly from mid-June to early August at two sites from 1991 to 1995. In the first three years, beetle density was generally low (<1 per plant), and did not differ among treatments. In the fourth year, however, beetle density peaked at 15 and 25 insects per plant at the two sites, and was highest within monoculture for most dates. In 1995, density was again low, but tended to remain higher in monoculture at one site. The results suggest that beetle density on D. illinoensis can be reduced in polyculture and may hold promise for the management of this insect herbivore within perennial grain polycultures.	1	WOS:A1996VM47100014	36	Anomoea flavokansiensis; Desmanthus illinoensis; perennials; polyculture	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; INSECT HERBIVORE; DIVERSE HABITATS; VEGETATIONAL DIVERSITY; DELIA-BRASSICAE; BEETLE; PHYLLOTRETA; ABUNDANCE; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS	Piper, JK	1996	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

L.), a perennial grain which has potential as a human or animal foodstuff. The potential to manage these diseases through intercropping eastern gamagrass with other, non-host perennial species was examined by monitoring incidence and severity on eastern gamagrass within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with wildrye (Leymus racemosus (Lam.) Tsvelev), two-species mixtures with Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis (Michx.) MacM., Leguminosae), and three-species mixtures with wildrye and Illinois bundleflower at two sites in Kansas, USA, from 1991 to 1995, Wildrye and bundleflower, which are also potential grain crops, are not reported to be hosts of the viruses. At Site 1, in 1991 and 1992, disease was generally less frequent and less severe in biculture with bundleflower and in the three-species mixture than in monoculture or the biculture with wildrye. No treatment effects were observed at Site 2. Disease severity was negatively correlated with plant size and seed yield at Site 1. Seed yield per plant was generally higher in polyculture than in monoculture. The results suggest polyculture may contribute to the management of aphid-borne plant disease within plantings of perennial grains.	4	WOS:A1996VU24200001	19	aphid vector; eastern gamagrass; mosaic virus; perennial grains; plant disease; polyculture; Tripsacum dactyloides	BEAN MONOCULTURES; MOSAIC-VIRUS; MAIZE; HOMOPTERA; APHIDIDAE; MIXTURES	Piper, JK; Handley, MK; Kulakow, PA	1996	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

From 1986 to 1992 I monitored seasonal net aboveground production and species composition at four sites with soils that differed in texture and percent organic matter, pH, and concentrations of NH4, total N, K, Ca, Mg, and SO4. Four years of the survey featured above normal precipitation and 3 were drought years. August standing crop averaged 566 +/- 307, 419 +/- 143, 268 +/- 158, and 232 +/- 148 g . m(-2) at the four sites. Production generally increased with soil fertility (i.e., percent organic matter, total N, and K) and precipitation. The two more productive sites featured higher percentages of grass biomass, but legumes were rare. The site with the lowest soil N supported the consistently highest legume biomass and lowest grass biomass among sites. The least productive site displayed the highest percentage of composites. Species evenness, but not richness, was inversely related to August biomass for all sites. There were significant differences in production across years, as well as in percentages of grass, legume, and composite biomass. Total plot richness ranged from 24 to 40 species sampled per year at site 2 to 51-53 species at site 4, and tended to decline in the dry year 1989. Poor soils, although less productive overall, appear to prevent dominance by tall grasses and thereby maintain relatively more diverse spring and summer floras. Increased light availability near the soil surface probably enables the persistence of low-growing plants. Evenness, but not richness, varied among sites. The patterns of plant community composition have implications for restoration ecology as well as the design of prairielike perennial grain mixtures.	16	WOS:A1995RZ63600015	49	DIVERSITY; EVENNESS; PLANT COMMUNITY; PRAIRIE; SOIL TYPE; VARIABILITY	EXPERIMENTAL NITROGEN GRADIENTS; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; SPECIES COMPOSITION; PERENNIAL GRASSES; USE EFFICIENCY; COMPETITION; AVAILABILITY; DIVERSITY; FERTILIZATION; DISTURBANCE	PIPER, JK	1995	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE	
Land Inst, Salina, KS 67401 USA	10.1016/S0167-8809(01)00247-X	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT	Natural systems agriculture: a truly radical alternative	NONE	The natural systems agriculture (NSA) idea was developed at The Land Institute in 1977 and was published in 1978. Less than 20 years later, research efforts at The Land Institute and by other researchers familiar with research questions had satisfactorily answered the difficult biological questions launching the possibility of a new agricultural paradigm toward fruition. This new paradigm features an ecologically sound perennial food-grain-producing system where soil erosion goes to near zero, chemical contamination from agrochemicals plummets, along with agriculture's dependence on fossil fuels. NSA is predicated on an evolutionary-ecological view of the world in which the essential's for sustainable living have been sorted out and tested in nature's ecosystems over millions of years. From numerous studies, evolutionary biologists and ecologists have learned much about how ecological bills are paid by ecosystems which hold and build soil, manage insects, pathogens and weeds. A primary feature of NSA is to sufficiently mimic the natural structure to be granted the function of its components. Domesticating wild perennials and increasing seed yield and at the same time perennializing the major crops to be planted as domestic prairies is a major goal. For the first time in 10,000 years, humans: can now build an agriculture based on nature's ecosystems. As a prototype this means we explore in-depth how the never-plowed native prairie works and then develop a diverse, perennial vegetative structure capable of producing desirable edible grains in abundance including perennializing the major grain crops. A paradigm shift of relatively easily manageable proportions is available to solve the problem of agriculture and is antithetical to solving problems in agriculture. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Hardin Cty Extens Off, Iowa Falls, IA 50126 USA	NONE	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE	Strip intercropping corn and alfalfa	NONE	Strip intercropping annual row crops can improve productivity, but the effect of strip cropping grain and perennial forage crops has not been thoroughly investigated. This study was conducted to evaluate the productivity and profitability of strip intercropping corn (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Alternating strips of corn and alfalfa of three widths (10, 20, and 40 ft) were compared in a field trial conducted from 1988 through 1990. Corn silking dates, heights, grain yields, and moisture were determined for each row within strips. Alfalfa yields and forage quality were determined for harvest strips within plots and for whole plots. Land equivalent ratios (LER) and gross returns to both strips and sole crops were calculated. In the drought of 1988, neither corn nor alfalfa yields differed due to strip width or from the sole crop yield. In 1989, corn yields were lowest for the sole crop (146 bu/acre), increased 3% in 40-ft strips, and 10% in 10- and 20-ft strips. In 1990, corn yields were also lowest for the sole crop (123 bu/acre), and increased 6% in 40-, 11% in 20-, and 17% in 10-ft wide strips. Alfalfa yields did not differ due to strip width or from the sole crop yield in 1989. In 1990, alfalfa yields in strips vs, the sole crop were reduced 10% only for the 10-ft wide plots. Land equivalent ratios were lowest in 1988, with values below 1.00 for 10- and 40-ft strips. All strip widths had values above 1.00 in subsequent years. Maximum LERs were 1.02, 1.08, and 1.06 for 20-ft strips in 1988, 1989, and 1990, respectively. In all years, 20-ft wide strips had the greatest economic advantage, returning $6, $29, and $17/acre over sole crops in 1988, 1989, and 1990, respectively. Increases in prices received for crops always increased the advantage of strip intercropping.	10	WOS:000075595500010	19	NONE	LAND EQUIVALENT RATIOS	Smith, MA; Carter, PR	1998	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

A perennial dual-purpose cereal could confer additional economic and environmental benefits. We establish that, at the end of a second growth season, selected perennial cereals were able to achieve up to 10-fold greater below-ground biomass than a resown annual wheat. We review and expand the data on available, diverse, perennial, wheat-derived germplasm, confirming that perenniality is achievable but that further improvements are essential through targeted breeding. Although not yet commercially deployable, the grain yields and dry matter production of the best performing lines approach the benchmarks predicted to achieve profitability. On reviewing the genomic composition of the most promising wheat-derived perennials, we conclude that the best near-term prospect of a productive breeding program for a perennial, wheat-derived cereal will utilise a diploid, perennial donor species, and the most promising one thus far is Thinopyrum elongatum. Furthermore, the breeding should be aimed at complete wheat-Th. elongatum amphiploids, a hybrid synthetic crop analogous to triticale. We advocate the generation of many primary amphiploids involving a diversity of Th. elongatum accessions and a diversity of adapted annual wheat cultivars. Primary perennial amphiploids would be inter-crossed and advanced with heavy, early-generation selection for traits such as semi-dwarf plant height, non-shattering heads, large seed size and good self-fertility, followed by later generation selection for robust perenniality, days to flowering, grain yield, forage yield, stability of grain yield across seasons, and disease resistance.	0	WOS:000345323600007	75	NONE	TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; PARTIAL AMPHIPLOIDS; THINOPYRUM-INTERMEDIUM; INTERGENERIC HYBRID; SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; HERBAGE PRODUCTION; EASTERN AUSTRALIA; CEREAL CROPS; RYE; PASTURES	Larkin, Philip J.; Newell, Matthew T.; Hayes, Richard C.; Aktar, Jesmin; Norton, Mark R.; Moroni, Sergio J.; Wade, Len J.	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

The aim was to improve crop production and land resource protection using innovative soil management practices. Tillage, mulch and perennial/annual rotational based systems were compared for 5 years in an Alfisol at ICRISAT in India. Crop yield parameters, including grain and biomass yield, leaf area index, crop cover, and plant height were measured. Results indicate significant benefits to annual crop yield (maize, sorghum) from improved water supply due to mulching with farmyard manure or and rice straw, and due to rotation with prior-perennial crops. Grain yields were 16 to 59% higher in mulched treatments compared to unmulched treatments, with similar increases for fodder yields. Annual crop yields after 4 years of perennials were 14 to 81% higher than unmulched treatments, except for low fertility maize grown after buffel grass. The interaction with chemical fertility was less clear than for water supply. The results have implications for soil management throughout the semi-arid tropics.

Thus, intermediate wheatgrass is currently being domesticated as a perennial grain crop. However, the genetic information for molecular breeding is quite limited. Here we report a molecular analysis of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in intermediate wheatgrass using gene cloning and protein biochemistry. Five HMW-GS genes were isolated from individual intermediate wheatgrass plants: two x-type genes TiHGS1 and TiHGS4, and three y-type genes TiHGS2, TiHGS3 and TiHGS5. Among them, TiHGS5 was novel and possessed an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminal domain or repetitive domain. Sequence alignments showed that TiHGS1 and TiHGS2 genes shared high identities (>96%) with the Glu-1Dx and Glu-1Dy genes, respectively, in common wheat and Aegilops species, TiHGS3 with HMW-GS genes from Dasypyrum or Pseudoroegneria, and TiHGS4 and TiHGS5 with HMW-GS genes from Thinopyrum elongatum. This work provides substantial new insights into the gene compositions and protein profiles of HMW-GS in intermediate wheatgrass, and also gives evidence about the genome components of intermediate wheatgrass.

Particularly in layered soils, interpretation of ECa variations would be enhanced with better calibrations to depth-wise variations in these soil properties. Thus, the objective of this research was to combine point measurements of layer conductivity obtained using ECa-equipped penetrometers with mapped ECa data from proximal sensors for improved quantification of conductivity-depth relationships in layered soils. Data were collected from a set of large plots on a claypan-soil landscape in central Missouri which had been managed in grain and perennial grass cropping systems for 20 years. Soil ECa variation with depth was represented by both two- and three-layer models that were visualized and parameterized with the use of penetrometer ECa data. The three-layer model provided a more realistic representation of the soil profiles in the study area and provided similar topsoil depth estimation accuracy as the commonly used two layer model. Penetrometer ECa data also provided efficient and accurate (r(2) = 0.92) estimation of calibration-point topsoil depth as an alternative to soil coring and manual determination. A key to accurate model calibration was selection of points from areas of spatially-homogeneous proximal ECa. Combining penetrometer ECa with proximal ECa data improved modeling of conductivity-depth relationships in terms of model selection, model parameterization, and model calibration.

We quantified impacts of perennial WSGs and row crops on soil wind erodibility parameters (erodible fraction, geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates, and aggregate stability) and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration under a dedicated bioenergy crop experiment in eastern Kansas after 4 and 5 yr of management. Soil properties were measured under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), and annual row crops including continuous corn (Zea mays L.), photoperiod sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], sweet sorghum, and grain sorghum. Perennial WSGs reduced wind erodible fraction by 1.08 to 1.16 times compared with row crops. The geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates under switchgrass and miscanthus was 2.8 to 4.5 times greater than under row crops. Dry soil aggregate stability under miscanthus and big bluestem was greater than under row crops. After 5 yr, differences in SOC concentration between WSGs and row crops were not statistically significant for the 0- to 15-cm depth. Photoperiod sensitive and sweet sorghum had greater biomass yield than WSGs. In 2011, miscanthus yielded more biomass than corn by 5.3 Mg ha(-1). Overall, growing dedicated bioenergy crops can reduce the soil's susceptibility to wind erosion but may not significantly increase SOC concentration in this region in the short term.	2	WOS:000322620600003	28	NONE	1ST 2 YEARS; AGGREGATE STABILITY; RESIDUE REMOVAL; SWITCHGRASS; PERFORMANCE; SEQUESTRATION; PRODUCTIVITY; WINDBARRIERS; EROSION; YIELD	Evers, Byron J.; Blanco-Canqui, Humberto; Staggenborg, Scott A.; Tatarko, John	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Treatments were combinations of three input levels (organic input under conventional tillage-ORG; reduced input under no-till-RED; and high input under conventional tillage-HIGH), three crop diversities (fallow-based rotations with low crop diversity-LOW; diversified rotations using annual cereal, oilseed and pulse grain crops-DAG; and diversified rotations using annual grain and perennial forage crops-DAP), and six crop phases including green manure (GM), chem-fallow or tilled-fallow (F). Amount of nitrate-N in 0-240 cm soil was usually highest under the HIGH input-LOW crop diversity treatment and lowest under the ORG input-DAP crop diversity treatment. The distribution of nitrate-N in various soil depths suggested downward movement of nitrate-N up to 240 cm depth, especially with LOW crop diversity compared to DAP crop diversity, and with HIGH input. In some years, the ORG input systems had higher nitrate-N than the RED or HIGH input systems, which was attributed to low extractable P in soil for optimum crop growth and reduced nutrient uptake with ORG input management. Extractable P in soil was higher by a small margin for HIGH or RED input relative to ORG input in the 0-15 cm layer, suggesting little downward movement of P. Crop diversity did not affect extractable soil P due to the low baseline levels of P in this soil. The proportion of fine dry aggregates (< 1.3 mm, erodible fraction) in 0-5 cm soil was highest with LOW crop diversity-HIGH input system, and lowest with DAG diversity-RED input system. The opposite was true for large aggregates (> 12.7 mm). Wet aggregate stability was higher for RED input compared to ORG and HIGH input, which was attributed to the increase in the concentration of organic C in aggregates in the RED input system. Amount of light fraction organic matter (LFOM), light fraction organic C (LFOC) and light fraction organic N (LFON) in 0-15 cm soil was higher for RED input compared to ORG and HIGH inputs, and higher for DAG and DAP crop diversities than for LOW crop diversity. Soil N and P were usually deficient under ORG input management, but large amounts of N and P were unaccounted for, or in surplus, under RED and HIGH inputs, despite a marked increase in plant N and P uptake and crop yield compared to ORG input. Overall, our findings suggest that soil quality can be improved and nutrient accumulation in the soil profile can be minimized by increasing cropping frequency, reducing/eliminating tillage, and using appropriate combinations of fertilizer input and diversified cropping.	19	WOS:000265307800001	84	Aggregation; Crop diversity; Extractable P; Input level; Nitrate-N; Nutrient balance; Organic C and N; Soil	LONG-TERM TILLAGE; DARK-BROWN SOIL; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN ACCUMULATION; FERTILIZER NITROGEN; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; NORTHWESTERN CHINA; CHERNOZEMIC SOILS; MATTER FRACTIONS	Malhi, S.

We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test EGG samples for virus infection. Over a 2-yr period, we found five instances of maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) and a high incidence (12 and 72% in 3-mo-old and 5-yr-old plantings, respectively) of sugarcane mosaic virus strain MDMV-B (SCMV-MDMV-B) in experimental breeding nurseries in Kansas. Incidence of SCMV-MDMV-B was higher in older breeding nurseries. SCMV-MDMV-B, but not MDMV, was found in three of 42 natural EGG stands. EGG plants infected by SCMV-MDMV-B showed no symptoms or a range of symptoms from mild mosaic to extensive chlorotic spots that became necrotic. EGG seedlings grown from two seed sources and inoculated in the greenhouse were infected by four MDMV and five SCMV-MDMV-B isolates. SCMV-MDMV-B apparently overwinters in infected EGG and has the potential to be a serious disease problem for this crop.	3	WOS:A1993KX44400002	23	NONE	GRASSES; TRANSMISSION; SORGHUM; CORN	SEIFERS, DL; HANDLEY, MK; BOWDEN, RL	1993	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

MacMillan] is an herbaceous perennial legume native to North America. Useful as a N-2-fixing plant in warm-season grass pastures, Illinois bundleflower is also a promising perennial grain crop. Knowledge of the distribution of genetic variation in Illinois bundleflower would increase efficiency of germplasm preservation and expedite plant breeding progress. The objective of this experiment was to determine the distribution of genetic variation within and between Illinois bundleflower accessions by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Semi-automated fluorescence-based AFLP analysis was performed on three individuals from each of 50 accessions. We identified 222 markers, 159 of which were polymorphic. Within-accession diversity was low (H-s = 0.013) compared with total gene diversity (H-T = 0.086). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 83% of the molecular variance was explained by two major clusters, supporting a previous phenotypic study that suggested the existence of two distinct races of Illinois bundleflower. The less commonly occurring of the two races contained greater genetic diversity and originated from a localized region in the south central USA. The collection of more accessions from throughout the USA and focused on the Southeast would likely increase the genetic variation available to plant breeders.	8	WOS:000181430300051	29	NONE	FLUORESCENCE-BASED AFLP; MARKERS; DESMANTHUS; COLLECTION; LEGUME; SPP.

L.) is a highly palatable warm season grass that has the potential to become a perennial grain crop with a high protein content (29% crude protein). Twelve wether lambs were used to evaluate eastern gamagrass grain and cottonseed meal as protein supplements for mature eastern gamagrass hay in a conventional digestion and nitrogen balance trial. Voluntary intake of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility, and nitrogen balance were determined for hay alone (CONTROL), hay plus eastern gamagrass grain (GGG), and hay plus cottonseed meal (CSM) treatments. Organic matter intake of supplemented lambs (25.7 g/kg BW) was higher (p<0.001) than lambs fed only hay (20.6 g/kg BW), There was no difference (p=0.22) in OM intake between GGG and CSM supplement treatments. Total tract digestibility of OM differed (p<0.001) among the GGG (61.8%), CSM (58.6%), and CONTROL (54.9%) treatments. However, differences in digestibility may be the result of addition of highly digestible protein and carbohydrate supplements, rather than an increase in digestibility of the hay. Digestibility of NDF was greater (p=0.01) for supplemented lambs (58.4%) than unsupplemented lambs (57.4%) and differed (p=0.04) between the CSM (59.1%) and GGG (57.7%) treatments. Addition of the supplements improved (p<0.001) the digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) of the total diet. The diet with GGG had more (p<0.001) favorable DE and ME values than the CSM supplemented ration. Nitrogen balance was more favorable (p<0.001) for supplemented (+5.7 g N/day) than for unsupplemented lambs (+1.7 g N/day), Lambs supplemented with GGG (+6.3 g N/day) retained more (p=0.01) nitrogen than lambs supplemented with CSM (+5.0 g N/day) even though nitrogen intake was similar (p=0.98), The difference in the nitrogen retention between the supplement treatments was the result of higher (p=0.01) urinary nitrogen excretion from the CSM as compared to the GGG treatment, while fecal nitrogen excretion was similar (p=0.63) for both supplement treatments. Eastern gamagrass grain was comparable to CSM as a protein supplement for moderate to low quality hay.

Grasses make up the vast majority of agricultural commodities. How these grasses capture, transport, and store carbohydrates underpins all aspects of crop productivity. Sink-source dynamics within the plant direct how much, where, and when carbohydrates are allocated, as well as determine the harvestable tissue. Carbohydrate partitioning can limit the yield capacity of these plants, thus offering a potential target for crop improvement. Grasses have the ability to buffer this sink-source interaction by transiently storing carbohydrates in stem tissue when production from the source is greater than whole-plant demand. These reserves improve yield stability in grain crops by providing an alternative source when photosynthetic capacity is reduced during the later phases of grain filling, or during periods of environmental and biotic stresses. Domesticated grasses such as sugarcane and sweet sorghum have undergone selection for high accumulation of stem carbohydrates, which serve as the primary sources of sugars for human and animal consumption, as well as ethanol production for fuel. With the enormous expectations placed on agricultural production in the near future, research into carbohydrate partitioning in grasses is essential for maintaining and increasing yields in grass crops. This review highlights the current knowledge of non-structural carbohydrate dynamics in grass stems and discusses the impacts of stem reserves in essential agronomic grasses.	27	WOS:000308010700001	247	Carbohydrate partitioning; grasses; non-structural carbohydrates; parenchyma cells; sink-source buffering; stem; yield stability	WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; SUGAR-RELATED TRAITS; PHLOEM LOADING STRATEGIES; PERENNIAL-GRAIN CROPS; DRY-MATTER YIELDS; BICOLOR L.

A review	NONE	Agroecology is a promising alternative to industrial agriculture, with the potential to avoid the negative social and ecological consequences of input-intensive production. Transitioning to agroecological production is, however, a complex project that requires diverse contributions from the outside of scientific institutions. Agroecologists therefore collaborate with traditional producers and agroecological movements. Permaculture is one such agroecological movement, with a broad international distribution and a unique approach to system design. Despite a high public profile, permaculture has remained relatively isolated from scientific research. Though the potential contribution of permaculture to agroecological transition is great, it is limited by this isolation from science, as well as from oversimplifying claims, and the lack of a clear definition. Here, we review scientific and popular permaculture literature. A systematic review discusses quantitative bibliometric data, including keyword analysis. A qualitative review identifies and assesses major themes, proposals, and claims. The manuscript follows a stratified definition of permaculture as design system, best practice framework, worldview, and movement. The major points of our analysis are as follows: (1) Principles and topics largely complement and even extend principles and topics found in the agroecological literature. (2) Distinctive approaches to perennial polyculture, water management, and the importance of agroecosystem configuration exceed what is documented in the scientific literature and thus suggest promising avenues of inquiry. (3) Discussions of practice consistently underplay the complexity, challenges, and risks that producers face in developing diversified and integrated production systems. (4) The movement is mobilizing diverse forms of social support for sustainability, in geographically diverse locations. (5) And scholarship in permaculture has always been a diverse marginal sector, but is growing.	0	WOS:000334170800001	192	Permaculture; Farmdesign; Perennial polyculture; Agroecological transition; Diversified farming systems; Agroecological movement	INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS; PERENNIAL-GRAIN CROPS; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS; NORTHEAST THAILAND; FOOD SOVEREIGNTY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; SOCIAL-MOVEMENT; GOOGLE SCHOLAR; UNITED-STATES	Ferguson, Rafter Sass; Lovell, Sarah Taylor	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

However, present estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of soils are based more on what is happening now than what might be changed by active agricultural intervention, and tend to concentrate only on the first metre of soil depth.; Scope Breeding crop plants with deeper and bushy root ecosystems could simultaneously improve both the soil structure and its steady-state carbon, water and nutrient retention, as well as sustainable plant yields. The carbon that can be sequestered in the steady state by increasing the rooting depths of crop plants and grasses from, say, 1 m to 2 m depends significantly on its lifetime(s) in different molecular forms in the soil, but calculations (http://dbkgroup.org/carbonsequestration/rootsystem.html) suggest that this breeding strategy could have a hugely beneficial effect in stabilizing atmospheric CO2. This sets an important research agenda, and the breeding of plants with improved and deep rooting habits and architectures is a goal well worth pursuing.	31	WOS:000294067000001	295	Breeding; deep roots; genetics; root architecture; carbon sequestration; nutrient efficiency; drought resistance; soil structure; perenniality	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION; PERENNIAL-GRAIN CROPS; ORYZA-SATIVA L.; LAND-USE CHANGE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS; GREENHOUSE-GAS MITIGATION; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; MAIZE INBRED LINES	Kell, Douglas B.	2011	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

The development of an NFRB protects our living environment from deterioration (especially soil erosion) by increasing the surface coverage of the world's land, even in mountainous areas. Additionally a functioning NFRB enhances food sustainably and security, representing a tangible and renewable food resource production system. Research has identified the prospects of cultivating the NFRB in the form of forestry and also grassland. The review investigated the distinct differences of an NFRB from a range of approaches and discusses the environmental advantage and feasibility of cultivating NFRB. The ability of the NFRB to realize sustainable food resources production for ensuring food security is evaluated in terms of environmental and economical feasibility. A NFRB can attenuate climatic change by increasing CO2 absorption and fixation. It is worth considering the replacement of the annual food production system by the NFRB (especially in steeplands) in environmental law, and replacing the policy of maintaining annual food reserves by the NFRB in food security policy.	0	WOS:000336458200003	56	Food resources; sustainability and security; food storage; cultivating; forestry; grassland	PERENNIAL-GRAIN CROPS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PALM TREE; CELLULOSE; HYDROLYSIS; PROSPECTS; ECOLOGY; EROSION; SYSTEMS; STARCH	Wu, Wenbiao; Yang, Yixing; Brennan, Charles S.; Huang, Wei	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 grain)	NONE

Since perennial plants allocate resources preferentially to perpetuation and to structural and functional characters that provide drought tolerance, they tend to have lower reproductive output (yield) than their congeneric annuals. Four species of Lesquerella native to arid regions were evaluated to understand the relationships between reproduction, drought tolerance, and their association with the plant's life span. We assessed the following set of characters (defined as plant strategies): phenology, gas exchange, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, total biomass and biomass allocation. Annual (Lesquerella gracilis and Lesquerella angustifolia) and perennial (Lesquerella mendocina and Lesquerella pinetorum) species were compared under water limiting conditions. Within this set of species differences in structural and functional characters were observed. The annual, L gracilis showed a plant strategy characterized by high reproductive output, harvest index (HI) and specific leaf area (SLA). L mendocina (perennial), produced more total biomass, but had a low reproductive output, and also showed characters that provide drought tolerance (high allocation to roots-root mass ratio (RMR), and storage-total non structural carbohydrates (TNC) and low SLA). The annual L angustifolia and the perennial L pinetorum had intermediate plant strategies (i.e. intermediate values of traits typically related with annual or perennial life span). In the case of L. pinetorum we found some traits common to L mendocina: long vegetative period, high biomass, CO(2) assimilation rate (A), and water use efficiency (WUE), and low SLA. The high reproductive output in L. pinetorum was a result of both, higher total biomass and longer growing season compared to the annuals, and of higher HI in relation to the other perennial. These differences in plant strategies among perennial Lesquerella show that there are different combinations of traits that could be used as criteria for the selection of a perennial crop in programs of domestication for Patagonia and others arid lands.

The interaction between the perennial pigeonpea and annual crops was measured at the tree-crop interface (TCI) by comparing the plants at the interface (I) and in the middle of the block planting (N).; Perennial pigeonpea I plants had significantly more branches and bigger stems than N plants at the onset of the following rainy season.  The greater number of flowers and grains of the I pigeonpea plants was partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to a better access to water.  On the other hand the negative effect on annual crops at the TCI extended to 1.5 m during the rainy season and to 2.5 m during the post-rainy season.  Significant reduction in the growth of annual crops occurred at 30-40 days after sowing and was associated with the shading by the taller pigeonpea.  Measurements of root profile of pigeonpea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was the major cause for yield reduction of chickpea during the post-rainy season but an allelopathetic effect may also be involved.  The results are compared with other TCI studies especially with Leucaena leucocephala in the semi-arid crops and the possible mechanisms for moisture interaction at the TCI are discussed.	4	WOS:A1991GZ28000001	0	TREE-CROP INTERFACE; RESOURCE UTILIZATION; PERENNIAL PIGEONPEA; SUNFLOWER; CHICKPEA; SEMIARID TROPICS	NONE	DANIEL, JN; ONG, CK; KUMAR, MS	1991	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE

Millsp.] was evaluated during 1993-95 on medium deep (50.6 cm) Alfisol in semi-arid environment. The treatments comprised improvement in planting sites (micrositing), minimal watering, use of castor (Ricinus communis L.) cake and plant-protection chemicals to achieve high grain yield and plant survival. Micrositing increased the grain, fodder and fuel production several-folds compared with sowing on flat bed soil (control) in first as well as second harvest in first and second year (ratoon). The yields were higher in the ratoon crop than in the first-year crop. Supply of water improved the grain production, although not significantly. Castor cake and micrositing caused lower seedling emergence initially, which improved with gap filling. The plant survival was excellent (87%) with micrositing but very poor (10%) with the control at 575 days after sowing. The highest survival and yield with micrositing may be due to the low bulk density (1.15 g/cc) and high plant-available water-holding capacity (112 mm) of the microsite-mixture profile. However, the survival at 650 days after sowing was poor (15-33%) in all the treatments due to severe and repeated attack of the termites (Odontotermes sp and Microtermes sp).	2	WOS:000071135800004	2	perennial pigeonpea; Cajanus cajan; survival; microsite; maximum yield	NONE	Nimbole, NN	1997	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE

A long-term experiment was started in July 1988 at ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, to evaluate practices to improve infiltration and reduce erosion by stimulating biological activity and protecting soil in the rainy season. This paper outlines the rationale for the experiment, describes it, and summarises early results. Fifteen treatments in a randomised block design were applied to plots 28.5 m long by 5 m wide on a 2% slope. Nine annual treatments made up a factorial sub-set: tillage by tined implement to three depths (0, 10 and 20 cm) combined with three mulch treatments (no mulch, farmyard manure (FYM) at 15 t ha-1, and rice straw at 5 t ha-1). Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was sown in the factorial sub-set in July 1988. Six perennial species ley treatments (combinations of perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), verano stylo (Stylosanthes hamata), and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris)) completed the randomised block design. All treatments were replicated three times making 45 plots in total. Plots were instrumented to measure runoff and soil loss.; Millet straw yield was reduced by tillage to 20 cm and grain yield was significantly reduced by tillage to both 10 and 20 cm. Mulches had no effect on millet straw yield but FYM significantly increased millet grain yield. The proportion of rainfall running off plots ranged from 15.8 to 39. 1%. Perennial species treatments tended to have higher runoff than treatments under millet, but this was not consistent as zero tillage without mulch, and tillage to 10 cm either with mulch or with FYM mulch, also had relatively high runoff. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by comparison with FYM and no mulch. Soil was lost mainly as suspended load, indicating that raindrop detachment was the main erosion process. Effects of perennial species were variable and probably reflected the degree of surface protection provided in this establishment phase. Tillage significantly increased suspended load concentration in the first major runoff event but not in an event later in the season. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced bed load concentration in the first event and reduced suspended load in the later event. The ability of straw mulch to reduce runoff volume and sediment concentration suggests mulch-based systems may be able to contribute to sustainability of farming systems in the semiarid tropics. The lack of beneficial effects from tillage suggests a limited role for tillage-based systems. Results from subsequent years are needed to form definite conclusions and to show effects of slower biologically-induced changes in the soil.	31	WOS:A1992JZ80600007	79	NONE	DRY SAVANNA WOODLANDS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; DEGRADED AREAS; TILLAGE; CULTIVATION; ENVIRONMENT; QUEENSLAND; GROWTH; INDIA	SMITH, GD; COUGHLAN, KJ; YULE, DF; LARYEA, KB; SRIVASTAVA, KL; THOMAS, NP; COGLE, AL	1992	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE

The objective of this study was to provide appropiate physiological indicators to describe plant performance under P deficiency early in the vegetative cycle of the annual non-cultivated Desmodium tortuosum (Sw) D.C. and the perennial Cajanus cajan (L.) Mllsp grown inside a highly ventilated greenhouse in 950-mL pots with sand irrigated with either 1.0 (T1) or 0.01 (T2) nM P in the Hoagland solution for a period of 35 or 45 days when growth pressure made differences between P treatments apparent. Results indicated that total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), but not relative leaf area expansion rate (RLAER), were drastically reduced in n plants in both species and that root length was reduced by 50% in Desmodium severely stressed T2 plants. The activity of acid phosphatase secreted by the roots in vivo increased under P deficiency in both species. The kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) of the secreted enzyme calculated from Lineweaver-Burk linear plots were different for the enzyme from T1 or T2 plants in both species. The numerical value of the Km for the substrate p-nitrophenyl-P provided a means of comparing the enzyme from high- or low-P plants. and it is suggested that Km, enzyme activity (Vmax), total leaf area and RGR (during exponential growth), may be used as physiological indicators to differentiate plants grown under P deficiency or sufficiency	9	WOS:A1996UJ93500076	17	NONE	ACID-PHOSPHATASE	Ascencio, J	1996	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE

Relatively higher amount of N release was observed in case of legume residues like mungbean (Vigna radiata), L. leucocephala and perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), although the rate of N release was more with low N concentration residues. Sorghum stover with C/N ratio of 72.1 resulted in immobilization of N upto 90 days. Nitrogen release was higher at FC than 50% FC. The critical N concentrations of the residues at which N neither released nor immobilized decreased with the length of incubation. At 50% FC the critical concentrations were higher than at FC.	12	WOS:A1993LW09900004	0	CRITICAL C/N RATIO; CRITICAL-N CONCENTRATION; CROP RESIDUE; IMMOBILIZATION; INCUBATION PERIOD; MOISTURE REGIME; NITROGEN RELEASE	NONE	DAS, SK; REDDY, GS; SHARMA, KL; VITTAL, KPR; VENKATESWARLU, B; REDDY, MN; REDDY, YVR	1993	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 cajanus)	NONE

Grain yields of resistant genotypes in the second season were double (4000 kg/ha) than those in the first (2000 kg/ha).	4	WOS:A1997YF18300001	9	agro-forestry; fusarium wilt; perennial pigeonpea; ratooning; resistance; sterility mosaic; Cajanus cajan	NONE	Reddy, MV; Raju, TN	1997	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

A long-term experiment was started in July 1988 at ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, to evaluate practices to improve infiltration and reduce erosion by stimulating biological activity and protecting soil in the rainy season. This paper outlines the rationale for the experiment, describes it, and summarises early results. Fifteen treatments in a randomised block design were applied to plots 28.5 m long by 5 m wide on a 2% slope. Nine annual treatments made up a factorial sub-set: tillage by tined implement to three depths (0, 10 and 20 cm) combined with three mulch treatments (no mulch, farmyard manure (FYM) at 15 t ha-1, and rice straw at 5 t ha-1). Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was sown in the factorial sub-set in July 1988. Six perennial species ley treatments (combinations of perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), verano stylo (Stylosanthes hamata), and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris)) completed the randomised block design. All treatments were replicated three times making 45 plots in total. Plots were instrumented to measure runoff and soil loss.; Millet straw yield was reduced by tillage to 20 cm and grain yield was significantly reduced by tillage to both 10 and 20 cm. Mulches had no effect on millet straw yield but FYM significantly increased millet grain yield. The proportion of rainfall running off plots ranged from 15.8 to 39. 1%. Perennial species treatments tended to have higher runoff than treatments under millet, but this was not consistent as zero tillage without mulch, and tillage to 10 cm either with mulch or with FYM mulch, also had relatively high runoff. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by comparison with FYM and no mulch. Soil was lost mainly as suspended load, indicating that raindrop detachment was the main erosion process. Effects of perennial species were variable and probably reflected the degree of surface protection provided in this establishment phase. Tillage significantly increased suspended load concentration in the first major runoff event but not in an event later in the season. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced bed load concentration in the first event and reduced suspended load in the later event. The ability of straw mulch to reduce runoff volume and sediment concentration suggests mulch-based systems may be able to contribute to sustainability of farming systems in the semiarid tropics. The lack of beneficial effects from tillage suggests a limited role for tillage-based systems. Results from subsequent years are needed to form definite conclusions and to show effects of slower biologically-induced changes in the soil.	31	WOS:A1992JZ80600007	79	NONE	DRY SAVANNA WOODLANDS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; DEGRADED AREAS; TILLAGE; CULTIVATION; ENVIRONMENT; QUEENSLAND; GROWTH; INDIA	SMITH, GD; COUGHLAN, KJ; YULE, DF; LARYEA, KB; SRIVASTAVA, KL; THOMAS, NP; COGLE, AL	1992	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

All entries were planted in hedgerows in August 1988 and were cut 1 m above ground level 229, 290 and 342 days after sowing. Dry matter yields for seven selected genotypes from the three cuttings combined ranged from 691 to 4083 g m-2, with significant differences between genotypes and significant genotype x environment interactions. Genotypes rarely combined more than two desirable alley cropping characters, suggesting a distinct role for selected genotypes in different alley cropping environments. None of the effects influencing growth and yield were constant over levels of the other factors studied, indicating a need for multi-locational testing and standardized sampling intervals in future genotype evaluations with perennial pigeonpea.	5	WOS:A1994NJ41400007	23	NONE	L MILLSP; TROPICS; INDIA; PEA	BOHRINGER, A; TAMO, M; DREYER, HM	1994	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

Two kg of red loamy sand soil representing Alfisol and related soil was incubated with the residues to supply 40 kg N ha-1 at 28 +/- 1-degrees-C at field capacity (FC) and 50% FC moisture conditions. Results obtained indicated that N content in soil released from residues increased with the time allowed for decomposition reactions at both FC and 50% FC moisture regimes. Relatively higher amount of N release was observed in case of legume residues like mungbean (Vigna radiata), L. leucocephala and perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), although the rate of N release was more with low N concentration residues. Sorghum stover with C/N ratio of 72.1 resulted in immobilization of N upto 90 days. Nitrogen release was higher at FC than 50% FC. The critical N concentrations of the residues at which N neither released nor immobilized decreased with the length of incubation. At 50% FC the critical concentrations were higher than at FC.	12	WOS:A1993LW09900004	0	CRITICAL C/N RATIO; CRITICAL-N CONCENTRATION; CROP RESIDUE; IMMOBILIZATION; INCUBATION PERIOD; MOISTURE REGIME; NITROGEN RELEASE	NONE	DAS, SK; REDDY, GS; SHARMA, KL; VITTAL, KPR; VENKATESWARLU, B; REDDY, MN; REDDY, YVR	1993	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

NONE	10.1017/S0014479797003104	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE	Pigeonpea in simultaneous fallow-cropping systems in the subhumid forest-savanna mosaic zone of West Africa	NONE	The potential of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) as a simultaneous fallow component in cropping systems is unique in that, being a shrubby grain legume, it combines food production with ease of establishment, fast growth and high biomass productivity. A study was carried out under on-farm conditions at three different sites in southern Benin, West Africa over two years to evaluate the biomass productivity and recycled nutrients of a local pigeonpea cultivar, managed as annual hedgerows. Pigeonpea was sown between a standard cassava-maize intercrop and compared with two other agroforestry systems and annual intercrops with and without mineral fertilizer. The number of cuts taken at a height of 1 m was doubled from two in 1991-92 to four in the 1992-93 season, leading to an increase in total cut dry matter by a factor of eight (1908 g m(-2)) and cut leaf dry matter by a factor of fourteen (1317 g m(-2)) in 1992-93. There were no trade-offs in subsequent dry grain (9.5 g m(-2)) and firewood yields (96.2 g m(-2)) for cutting hedges earlier and more often during the second year, despite much lower precipitation. In pigeonpea recycled nutrients, N, P, Ca, Mg and K, increased proportionally to cut dry matter yields. Yield increases over two years with pigeonpea were highest among all evaluated cropping systems for maize (+ 150%) and significant for cassava (+ 66%). Pigeonpea as a simultaneous fallow component in cassava-maize intercropping, can help to sustain moderate yields of maize and cassava, provided thar. insects, nematodes and diseases do not lower its high biomass productivity with continued cropping after two years.	1	WOS:A1997XP32300005	16	NONE	CAJAN L MILLSP; PERENNIAL PIGEONPEA; PRODUCTIVITY; GROWTH	Bohringer, A; Leihner, DE	1997	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 pigeonpea)	NONE

If perennial cultivars of upland rice were developed, they would provide farmers with an inexpensive tool to produce a preferred food while conserving soil. O. rufipogon, the undomesticated progenitor of O.sativa, includes perennial and stoloniferous forms. To evaluate the feasibility of developing perennial cultivars by combining genes of O.sativa and O.rufipogon, four trials were conducted in an upland field at IRRI:O. sativalO. rufipogon F-1 clone and cutting height trial, F-2 family trial, and two O.scitiva/stoloniferous-selection factorial mating design trials. Plants were established at the beginning of the rainy season, then subjected to a 6-month dry season and evaluated for survival after 1 year. Of the 2101 cultivar control plants, only three IR47686-1-4-B individuals survived and none produced stolons. The 18 F, clones, which were selected from previous trials with less drought stress, ranged in survival from 4.4 to 91.4%. Cutting height at harvest did not affect survival. Survival among the F,, families ranged from 9.4 to 31.9%. Segregation for stolon presence did not differ from a 3:1 ratio for five of the six F2 families, suggesting the effect of a single dominant gene. Average yields per plant for the F2 families were 1/3 to 1/9 of yields for the cultivars. However, by crossing the F(1)s to cultivars, yield potential was almost fully recovered. For the full-sib families of the factorial trials, survival ranged from 0.0 to 48.6%. Azucena and IR47686-1-4-B, both japonica cultivars, exhibited greater general combining ability for survival relative to the six other cultivar parents. Thus, the process of developing perennial cultivars of rice should include screening annual cultivars to identify those with the best combining ability for survival. To develop cultivars of perennial upland rice, drought avoidance and/or tolerance from annual upland cultivars must be combined with the capacity for perennial growth from wild perennial species. The frequency of stolonifereous testcross progeny was lower than expected and was affected by the 0. sativa parent. Thus, additional genes likely affected stolon penetrance and expression. Analyses of covariance indicated that stolons improved the likelihood of survival for progenies of the factorial trials but the effect was small (b < 0.1), and that yield (g/plant) had a small negative effect on percent survival (b = -0.13 to -0.32). This study demonstrated that it was possible to introgress genes for perennial growth from wild 0. rufipogon accessions into domesticated 0. sativa. Additionally,strategic, for developing perennial cultivars Of upland rice were improved. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent research has demonstrated that the Australian AA genome perennial populations have maternal genomes more closely related to those of O. meridionalis than to those found in Asian populations of O. rufipogon suggesting that the Australian perennials may represent a new distinct gene pool for rice.; Results: Analysis of an Oryza core collection covering AA genome species from Asia to Oceania revealed that some Oceania perennials had organellar genomes closely related to that of O meridionalis (meridionalis-type). O. rufipogon accessions from New Guinea carried either the meridionalis-type or rufirpogon-type (like O. rufipogon) organellar genomes. Australian perennials carried only the meridionalis-type organellar genomes when accompanied by the rufipogon-type nuclear genome. New accessions were collected to better characterize the Australian perennials, and their life histories (annual or perennial) were confirmed by field observations. All of the material collected carried only meridionalis-type organellar genomes. However, there were two distinct perennial groups. One of them carried an rufipogon-type nuclear genome similar to the Australian O. rufipogon in the core collection and the other carried an meridionalis-type nuclear genome not represented in the existing collection. Morphologically the rufipogon-type shared similarity with Asian O. rufipogon. The meridionalis-type showed some similarities to O. meridionalis such as the short anthers usually characteristic of annual populations. However, the meridionalis-type perennial was readily distinguished from O. meridionalis by the presence of a larger lemma and higher number of spikelets.; Conclusion: Analysis of current accessions clearly indicated that there are two distinct types of Australian perennials. Both of them differed genetically from Asian O. rufipogon. One lineage is closely related to O. meridionalis and another to Asian O. rufipogon. The first was presumed to have evolved by divergence from O. meridionalis becoming differentiated as a perennial species in Australia indicating that it represents a new gene pool. The second, apparently derived from Asian O. rufipogon, possibly arrived in Australia later.	3	WOS:000329808100003	40	Genetic divergence; Australia; Perennial; Annual; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza meridionalis	CULTIVATED RICE; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS; SATIVA L.; ORIGIN; GENOME; RESISTANCE; GENES; SEQUENCES; STRAINS	Sotowa, Masahiro; Ootsuka, Kenta; Kobayashi, Yuu; Hao, Yin; Tanaka, Katsunori; Ichitani, Katsuyuki; Flowers, Jonathan M.; Purugganan, Michael D.; Nakamura, Ikuo; Sato, Yo-Ichiro; Sato, Tadashi; Crayn, Darren; Simon, Bryan; Waters, Daniel L.

The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species. Results have possible applications to improve perennial forage and turf grasses, extend the vegetative life cycle of annual cereals, such as wheat, or control the invasiveness of highly rhizomatous weeds such as quackgrass (Elymus repens).	1	WOS:000336728600011	89	Auxin signaling; Grasses; Gravitropism; Perenniality; Phototropism; Rhizomes	PLANT-GROWTH; LINKAGE MAPS; REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; APICAL DOMINANCE; ELYTRIGIA-REPENS; LEYMUS-WILDRYES; AUXIN RESPONSE; GRAIN CROPS; RICE	Yun, Lan; Larson, Steve R.; Mott, Ivan W.; Jensen, Kevin B.; Staub, Jack E.	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 oryza)	NONE

To understand the metabolic characteristics of perennial rice, in the present study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to profile the distribution patterns of 33 primary metabolites and hormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and zeatin riboside (ZR)] of annual (RD23) and perennial (Oryza longistaminata and the line AA with RD23 genetic background) rice genotypes. Results showed that both metabolites and hormones have distinct genotype and organ distribution patterns, and considerable variations were observed between the metabolites in stem bases of perennial and annual rice. Most of the metabolites, including sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, significantly accumulated in the stem bases of perennial rice by decreasing the level in roots and leaves. Fifteen metabolites consistently accumulated significantly in the stem bases of both perennial genotypes. Additionally, the organ-level IAA content and IAA/ZR ratio in the two perennials were considerably higher than those in RD23. The present study indicated that the significant accumulation of the metabolites at stem base and the higher IAA/ZR ratio are involved in the regulatory metabolism for rhizome development.	1	WOS:000299002400009	31	Rice; Metabolite profiling; Phytohormone; Rhizome	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; FIELD PERFORMANCE; ARABIDOPSIS; EXPRESSION; SORGHUM; LONGISTAMINATA; IDENTIFICATION; PHENOTYPES; GROWTH; GENES	Zhao, Xiuqin; Zhang, Ting; Huang, Liyu; Wu, Huimin; Hu, Fengyi; Zhang, Fan; Zhu, Linghua; Fu, Binying	2012	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 oryza)	U0836605; 2008ZX001-003

A practical way to improve hybrid seed production is to increase the outcrossing rate in rice. Several studies reveal that perennial wild Oryza species have a higher outcrossing rate than annual species. Among various traits that influence outcrossing, pistil characteristics are the most crucial in improving the seed set on the male sterile parent in hybrid seed production. Wild species are known to have wide genetic variability for stigma length, anther length, and percent stigma exsertion. This review establishes the need to exploit new genetic resources, through both classical and molecular breeding approaches, to improve seed production. It also reviews the genetic variability of floral characteristics, the genetics of floral traits that influence outcrossing, and progress made in understanding these traits using biotechnological approaches, the effect of environment on floral traits and the resulting prospects for improving hybrid rice seed production.	0	WOS:000346023200001	110	Rice; Floral traits; Outcrossing; Genetics; QTL; Gene; Hybrid seed production	MADS-BOX GENE; ORYZA-SATIVA L.; 10 GENOME TYPES; CULTIVATED RICE; FLOWER DEVELOPMENT; STIGMA EXSERTION; ANTHER DEVELOPMENT; OVULE DEVELOPMENT; ORGAN IDENTITY; GRAIN LENGTH	Marathi, Balram; Jena, Kshirod K.	2015	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 oryza)	NONE

Fructan molecules accumulate in cell vacuoles of perennial ryegrass and wheat and are associated with abiotic stress tolerance. High levels of amino acid similarity between the fructosyltransferases responsible for fructan accumulation indicates that the), may have evolved from invertase-like ancestral genes. In this study, we have applied comparative genomics to determine the mechanisms that lead to the evolution of fructosytransferase and invertase genes in rice, perennial ryegrass, and wheat. Duplications and rearrangements have been inferred to generate variant forms of the rice invertases since divergence from a common grass progenitor. The occurrence of multiple copies of fructosyltransferase genes indicated that duplication events continued during evolution of the wheat and perennial ryegrass lineages. Further gene rearrangements were evident in perennial ryegrass genes, albeit at a reduced level compared with the rice invertases. Gene orthologs were largely static after duplication during evolution of the wheat lineage. This study details evolutionary events that contribute to fructosyltransferase and invertase gene variation in grasses.	17	WOS:000242212000003	25	fructosyltransferase; invertase; comparative genomics; gene rearrangement; genome evolution	SUCROSE-SUCROSE 1-FRUCTOSYLTRANSFERASE; CHROMOSOME BIN MAP; DRAFT SEQUENCE; LOLIUM-PERENNE; COMMON WHEAT; FRUCTAN; COLINEARITY; EVOLUTION; JAPONICA	Francki, Michael G.; Walker, Esther; Forster, John W.; Spangenberg, German; Appels, Rudi	2006	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

NONE	Domesticated rice, Oryza sativa L, though a perennial, is nowadays usually cultivated as an annual. This has led a number of commentators to misinterpret the historical record. The older view that rice was domesticated around the Bay of Bengal and in parts of mainland Southeast Asia has been replaced by competing views of earliest domestication in that region and in the Yangzi valley. Botanical considerations point clearly to the retention of perennial characteristics while archaeological and historical evidences point to cultivation with more than a single harvest from an initial planting - the practice of ratooning. Evidence is reviewed briefly for China and more extensively for Southeast Asia. Modern field evidence is used to support the notion that ratooning was probably more widespread in the past and that this practice may represent an early phase in the history of rice agriculture in Southeast Asia as it does in China.

We wish to develop a perennial upland rice that would help conserve natural resources via a permanent ground cover, while providing subsistence farmers with a valued food. Oryza longistaminata A. Chev. et Roehr. is a highly perennial, rhizomatous relative of O. sativa that may be a useful source of genes for developing perennial upland rice. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of an O. sativa/O. longistaminata intermated population for developing perennial upland rice. As a baseline for comparison, none of the cultivar controls survived 1 yr. Among 94 S, families, 1-yr survival ranged from 0 to 63.6% but only six families had more than 30% survival. On the basis of observations at the soil surface, less than 1% of the progeny plants produced rhizomes. However, three families produced approximately 25% rhizomatous individuals, suggesting the presence of a single locus with large effect. Interspecific crossing barriers led to low S, yields, with many plants being completely sterile. The low fertility and limited perenniality observed may make further breeding progress with this population difficult.	15	WOS:000181430300018	16	NONE	NONE	Sacks, EJ; Roxas, JP; Cruz, MTS	2003	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

The objective of this study was to determine if O. rufipogon Griff., the wild ancestor of cultivated Asian rice, would be a useful source of genes for introgressing perennial growth habit into cultivated rice. In two trials conducted at the International Rice Research Institute, cultivars were compared with interspecific F(1)s or with rapidly advanced F-4 and BC1F4 families, respectively. After 1 yr, none of the cultivars survived but survival in progeny families ranged from 0 to 85.7%. Average survival for the F(1)s was 30.6% and only one family out of 31 had no survivors. Correlations between F-1 family survival and parental O. rufipogon vigor at 9 mo and 20 mo indicated that at least 1 yr is needed to identify perennial genotypes. Fertility among the progeny was generally good, which should facilitate further breeding efforts. In contrast to the cultivars, which produced only one main crop at the end of the wet season, many progenies produced a ratoon crop during the dry season even though they were drought stressed. The ability to produce a dry season ratoon crop under upland conditions is a new opportunity for increasing food security of subsistence upland rice farmers. Breeding perennial cultivated rice should be feasible but it will likely take 5 to 10 more years.	19	WOS:000181430300017	29	NONE	SOIL-EROSION; HYBRIDS; AGRICULTURE; POPULATION	Sacks, EJ; Roxas, JP; Cruz, MTS	2003	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

The evolution of annual O. nivara from a perennial ancestor resembling its sister species, O. rufipogon, was associated with an ecological shift from persistently wet to seasonally dry habitats. Here we report a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of phenotypic differentiation in life history, mating system, and flowering time between O. nivara and O. rufipogon. The exponential distribution of effect sizes of QTL fits the prediction of a recently proposed population genetic model of adaptation. More than 80% of QTL alleles of O. nivara acted in the same direction of phenotypic evolution, suggesting that they were fixed under directional selection. The loss of photoperiod sensitivity, which might be essential to the survival of the ancestral populations of O. nivara in the new environment, was controlled by QTL of relatively large effect. Mating system evolution from cross- to self-fertilization through the modification of panicle and floral morphology was controlled by QTL of small-to-moderate effect. The lack of segregation of the recessive annual habit in the F(2) mapping populations suggested that the evolution of annual from perennial life form had a complex genetic basis. The study captured the genetic architecture for the adaptive origin of O. nivara and provides a foundation for rigorous experimental tests of population genetic theories of adaptation.	23	WOS:000264379200006	83	Adaptation; life history; mating system; natural selection; perennial rice; photoperiod; QTL; self-fertilization	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; MATING SYSTEM DIVERGENCE; SATIVA L.; LEPTOSIPHON POLEMONIACEAE; MIMULUS-GUTTATUS; CULTIVATED RICE; EVOLUTION; DOMESTICATION; ADAPTATION; PERENNIS	Grillo, Michael A.; Li, Changbao; Fowlkes, Angela M.; Briggeman, Trevor M.; Zhou, Ailing; Schemske, Douglas W.; Sang, Tao	2009	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

DIFFERENCES IN REGENERATING STRATEGIES AMONG GENETIC STOCKS	NONE	Variation in the mode of regeneration in a perennial (W120), an annual (W630), and an intermediate perennial-annual type (W593) of common wild rice was tested in lowland fields in semi-natural conditions. The perennial type continued vegetative growth vigorously and increased its population size in a few years. This type also produced a few seedlings. In contrast, the annual type was unsuccessful. Seeds were dispersed and buried in soil, but they did not germinate in the next season. Furthermore, the mother plants died out. Seed germination of this type was sensitive to soil substrates and seemed to be suppressed, at least partly, by an allelopathic effect of field weeds. The intermediate type after maturity covered the field with a thick layer of litter preventing weed growth. In the next season, the seeds germinated to form a new population which included a few mother plants that remained alive vegetatively. Thus, the three genotypes showed markedly different regenerating strategies. Soil-buried seeds of all types survived for years in spite of high moisture content and high temperatures.	4	WOS:A1992HR81400004	14	ANNUAL TYPE; BURIED SEED; COMMON WILD RICE; PERENNIAL TYPE; REGENERATION; SEED LONGEVITY	ORYZA-PERENNIS; SURVIVAL	OKA, HI	1992	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

In this stud, we examined an intermated Oryza sativalOtyza longistandnata population and assessed how fertility barriers affected selection for long rhizomes, a polygenic trait. Rhizomes are typical of O. longistaminata but not found in O. sativa. In the intermate population, we observed that pollen-fertility and self-fertility were generally low but exceptional individuals of high fertility were found in nearly all generations. About 1/5th of the genotypic variation for self-fertility was accounted for by pollen-fertility, based on a significant linear regression. Intermating improved self-fertility more than backcrossing for one generation. Heritability estimates via parent-offspring regression were 17 +/- 7% for pollen-fertility and 39 +/- 9% for self-fertility. The data indicated that many genes contributed to the fertility barriers. Individuals with relatively high fertility or long rhizomes (> 8 cm) were observed infrequently in the intermated population, and there was no evidence of association between low fertility and presence of long rhizomes. By evaluating a large population, we were able to obtain a few rare recombinants that had both self-fertility greater than 10% and long rhizomes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is recalcitrant for in vitro manipulation. In this study, various parameters affecting Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated infection were tested to optimize transformation efficiency in perennial ryegrass. The effects of heat shock and maltose concentration during Agrobacterium infection were evaluated along with variations in callus induction medium, bacterial infection media and callus age. Our results suggest that Agrobacterium infection at 42 A degrees C for 3 min and co-cultivation of Agrobacterium-infected callus on a high maltose medium (6 %) significantly enhances the transformation efficiency in perennial ryegrass. The most optimal conditions proved to be use of four-month-old embryogenic callus induced on a modified N6 medium, infected with Agrobacterium grown on a modified Murashige and Skoog (MSM) medium, and a 42 A degrees C heat shock treatment followed by the co-cultivation of the Agrobacterium and the callus on medium containing 6 % maltose (instead of 3 %). Using this optimized protocol, we were able to increase the transformation efficiencies for regenerated plants from approximately 1 % to over 20 %. Significant improvement in rice stable transformation efficiency was also observed when the optimized conditions were applied to this important cereal, indicating the method described here may apply to other monocots as well.	6	WOS:000320562300003	45	Heat shock; Maltose; Rice; Perennial ryegrass; Transformation	GENETIC-TRANSFORMATION; DNA TRANSFER; MAIZE; BOMBARDMENT; CELLS; L.; CENTRIFUGATION; ESTABLISHMENT; REGENERATION; INDUCTION	Patel, Minesh; Dewey, Ralph E.; Qu, Rongda	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

To understand the metabolic characteristics of perennial rice, in the present study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to profile the distribution patterns of 33 primary metabolites and hormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and zeatin riboside (ZR)] of annual (RD23) and perennial (Oryza longistaminata and the line AA with RD23 genetic background) rice genotypes. Results showed that both metabolites and hormones have distinct genotype and organ distribution patterns, and considerable variations were observed between the metabolites in stem bases of perennial and annual rice. Most of the metabolites, including sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, significantly accumulated in the stem bases of perennial rice by decreasing the level in roots and leaves. Fifteen metabolites consistently accumulated significantly in the stem bases of both perennial genotypes. Additionally, the organ-level IAA content and IAA/ZR ratio in the two perennials were considerably higher than those in RD23. The present study indicated that the significant accumulation of the metabolites at stem base and the higher IAA/ZR ratio are involved in the regulatory metabolism for rhizome development.	1	WOS:000299002400009	31	Rice; Metabolite profiling; Phytohormone; Rhizome	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; FIELD PERFORMANCE; ARABIDOPSIS; EXPRESSION; SORGHUM; LONGISTAMINATA; IDENTIFICATION; PHENOTYPES; GROWTH; GENES	Zhao, Xiuqin; Zhang, Ting; Huang, Liyu; Wu, Huimin; Hu, Fengyi; Zhang, Fan; Zhu, Linghua; Fu, Binying	2012	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	U0836605; 2008ZX001-003

Oryza longistaminata is an undomesticated, perennial, rhizomatous relative of domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa). Using five sets of 4 x 2 factorial mating designs, we crossed rhizomatous interspecific genotypes (lGs) from an interniated 0. sativaffi. longistandnata population with male-fertile IG selections from the intermated population, and with O. sativa CVs. Parents and progeny were planted in an upland field at IRRI using a randomized complete block design and evaluated for rhizome expression, survival after 1 year, vigor of the survivors, and yield. For the IG parents, rhizome expression was variable and penetrance of most genotypes was incomplete, but genotypes that demonstrated the potential for moderate rhizome expression had high penetrance (89% average). The CV parents yielded 11.0 g/plant on average but none produced rhizomes or survived I year. The IG parents averaged yields of 3.1 g/plant, 57% rhizonnatous and 36% survival. The IG/IG progeny averaged yields of 4.2 g/plant, 32% rhizomatous and 37% survival. The IG/CV progeny averaged yields of 6.0 g/plant, 18% rhizomatous and 16% survival. Nine IGAG progeny and six IG/CV progeny were rhizomatous, perennial, and yielded at least 5 g/plant, and five of these yielded more than 10 g/plant. For the IG parents and IG/IG progeny, rhizome presence and expression were positively associated with survival and vigor of the survivors. General combining ability effects were significant for percent survival and yield but not percent rhizomatous. Specific combining ability effects were significant for percent rhizomatous, percent survival and yield. By selecting female parents for long rhizomes and male parents for fertility, considerable gains in rhizome expression, survival and yield were made. The development of perennial upland rice CVs should be feasible via introgression of genes from O. longistaminata. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species. Results have possible applications to improve perennial forage and turf grasses, extend the vegetative life cycle of annual cereals, such as wheat, or control the invasiveness of highly rhizomatous weeds such as quackgrass (Elymus repens).	1	WOS:000336728600011	89	Auxin signaling; Grasses; Gravitropism; Perenniality; Phototropism; Rhizomes	PLANT-GROWTH; LINKAGE MAPS; REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; APICAL DOMINANCE; ELYTRIGIA-REPENS; LEYMUS-WILDRYES; AUXIN RESPONSE; GRAIN CROPS; RICE	Yun, Lan; Larson, Steve R.; Mott, Ivan W.; Jensen, Kevin B.; Staub, Jack E.	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

However, most available information on weed control with herbicides is related to flood irrigated rice because this is the main growing method. Field experiments were conducted at Zaragoza (Spain) during two years to study weed control and tolerance of sprinkler irrigated rice to several herbicides. The main weeds were Atriplex prostrata Boucher ex DC., Cyperus rotundus L., Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. and Sonchus oleraceus L. Rice cv Guadiamar was tolerant to preemergence (PRE) application of clomazone at 0.36 kg ha(-1) and oxadiazon at 0.5 kg ha(-1). PRE application of pendimethalin at 1.32 kg ha-1 combined with clomazone at 0.36 kg ha(-1) decreased rice yield.

Only treatments that controlled grassy weeds since rice was planted and by more than 80% at harvest time lead to acceptable rice yield (>5,000 kg ha(-1)). Clomazone applied PRE at 0.36 kg ha(-1) provided good control of grassy weeds (>80%) and the highest rice yield, so it is recommended as a selective and efficacious PRE treatment for weed control of annual weeds in sprinkler irrigated rice. The perennial purple nutsedge was difficult to control at high plant densities (> 150 plants m(-2)) and the recommended herbicide is azimsulfuron applied at POST at 0.02 kg ha(-1).	1	WOS:000291519600027	37	irrigation system; upland rice; weed competition	ECHINOCHLOA-CRUS-GALLI; DIRECT-SEEDED RICE; NUTSEDGE CYPERUS-ROTUNDUS; FED UPLAND RICE; CULTIVAR TOLERANCE; CLOMAZONE; MANAGEMENT; SOIL; GROWTH	Cavero, J.; Zaragoza, C.; Cirujeda, A.; Anzalone, A.; Faci, J.

In order to develop a strategy for evaluation of natural resources, systematic leaf sampling has been conducted and their genetic characteristics measured with 16 SSR loci. In order to determine population structure, a small number of individuals localized together were regarded as sub-populations belonging to a single mother population. Annual individuals were clustered at particular peripheral areas of the pond. Perennial individuals were close by and growing within deeper pond water. Scores of observed heterozygosity (Ho) were not significantly different between annual and perennial sub-populations, but relatively lower in annual ones. Genetic distance among annual and perennial sub-populations in close juxtaposition at peripheral sites showed that annuals were clustered against perennials. In addition, comparison of perennial sub-populations peripheral areas and inside the swamp, found they clustered together and were some distance from annual ones. When the genetic components were compared in detail, private alleles were frequently found in annual plants, suggesting there might be restriction of gene flow between annual and perennial types. Partitions of deep water perennial sub-populations identified private alleles in particular areas, suggesting there were some areas with unique polymorphisms. Combining peripheral perennial sub-populations led to the disappearance of most private alleles which implied there is frequent gene flow among perennial sub-populations. This in-situ conservation site allowed us to observe the succession of populations and also to research detailed population structure of a typical wild population and this found wild rice genetic structure in this single swamp is complex. The data obtained will provide valuable insight about how to evaluate wild populations genetically and how to deal with such populations as field collections.	0	WOS:000323535400004	37	annual-perennial differentiation; in-situ conservation; life history; Oryza rufipogon; population structure	ORYZA-RUFIPOGON GRIFF.; O-NIVARA SHARMA; CULTIVATED RICE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SATIVA L.; MARKERS; PERENNIS; DIFFERENTIATION; DNA; MICROSATELLITE	Wang, Yan-Ping; Bounphanousay, Chay; Kanyavong, Kongpanh; Nakamura, Ikuo; Sato, Yo-Ichiro; Sato, Tadashi; Zhang, Hong-Sheng; Tang, Ling-hua; Ishikawa, Ryuji	2012	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	28; 21405016; 15405041

NONE	To clarify the inter- and intraspecific variations of floral traits in rice, we investigated eleven traits related to pistil, stamen and glume using 128 Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) accessions including 72 Indica and 56 Japonica type accessions, and 53 wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.) accessions including 32 perennial and 21 annual ecotype accessions. We examined the results from three specific levels: intraspecific variation between perennial and annual ecotypes of wild rice, interspecific variation between cultivated rice and wild rice, and intraspecific variation between Indica and Japonica type cultivars. The annual wild rice accessions exhibited a shorter stigma and anther than the perennial wild rice ones. The cultivated rice accessions showed a lower stigma exertion, shorter stigma, shorter anther, and thicker and wider lemma and palea than the wild rice accessions. These floral traits of cultivated rice are considered to play an important role in selfing and high seed production. None of the floral traits showed distinct differences between the Indica and Japonica type accessions in cultivated rice, although the Indica type accessions tended to display a slenderer stigma and glume than the Japonica type accessions. It is suggested that the varietal differentiation into the Indica and Japonica types is not likely to be related to genetic variations of floral traits. We clarified the differences in floral traits between annual and perennial ecotypes of wild rice, between cultivated rice and wild rice, and between the Indica and Japonica type cultivars, and discussed the relationship between genetic variations of floral traits and domestication and varietal differentiation in rice.	10	WOS:000187958500009	26	floral trait; Asian cultivated rice (Oryza. sativa L.); wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.); Indica and Japonica; perennial and annual ecotypes	PERENNIS; DIFFERENTIATION; DIVERSITY; INDICA; ORIGIN	Uga, Y; Fukuta, Y; Ohsawa, R; Fujimura, T	2003	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

If perennial cultivars of upland rice were developed, they would provide farmers with an inexpensive tool to produce a preferred food while conserving soil. O. rufipogon, the undomesticated progenitor of O.sativa, includes perennial and stoloniferous forms. To evaluate the feasibility of developing perennial cultivars by combining genes of O.sativa and O.rufipogon, four trials were conducted in an upland field at IRRI:O. sativalO. rufipogon F-1 clone and cutting height trial, F-2 family trial, and two O.scitiva/stoloniferous-selection factorial mating design trials. Plants were established at the beginning of the rainy season, then subjected to a 6-month dry season and evaluated for survival after 1 year. Of the 2101 cultivar control plants, only three IR47686-1-4-B individuals survived and none produced stolons. The 18 F, clones, which were selected from previous trials with less drought stress, ranged in survival from 4.4 to 91.4%. Cutting height at harvest did not affect survival. Survival among the F,, families ranged from 9.4 to 31.9%. Segregation for stolon presence did not differ from a 3:1 ratio for five of the six F2 families, suggesting the effect of a single dominant gene. Average yields per plant for the F2 families were 1/3 to 1/9 of yields for the cultivars. However, by crossing the F(1)s to cultivars, yield potential was almost fully recovered. For the full-sib families of the factorial trials, survival ranged from 0.0 to 48.6%. Azucena and IR47686-1-4-B, both japonica cultivars, exhibited greater general combining ability for survival relative to the six other cultivar parents. Thus, the process of developing perennial cultivars of rice should include screening annual cultivars to identify those with the best combining ability for survival. To develop cultivars of perennial upland rice, drought avoidance and/or tolerance from annual upland cultivars must be combined with the capacity for perennial growth from wild perennial species. The frequency of stolonifereous testcross progeny was lower than expected and was affected by the 0. sativa parent. Thus, additional genes likely affected stolon penetrance and expression. Analyses of covariance indicated that stolons improved the likelihood of survival for progenies of the factorial trials but the effect was small (b < 0.1), and that yield (g/plant) had a small negative effect on percent survival (b = -0.13 to -0.32). This study demonstrated that it was possible to introgress genes for perennial growth from wild 0. rufipogon accessions into domesticated 0. sativa. Additionally,strategic, for developing perennial cultivars Of upland rice were improved. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

NONE	NONE	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF BREEDING	GENETIC COMPARISONS OF CHROMOSOME 6 BETWEEN WILD AND CULTIVATED RICE	NONE	In order to examine genetic differentiation in chromosome 6 of rice, a perennial accession of the wild progenitor, Oryza rufipogon, was backcrossed with a near-isogenic line of Taichung 65 with wx (T65wx, Japonica type of O. sativa) as the reccurrent parent. The wild accession used was proved to carry gamete eliminator, S6, which was loosely linked with the wx locus on chromosome 6. S6 induced abortion of gametes carrying the opposite allele, S6a, only in the heterozygotes (S6/S6a), and as a result no S6a transmitted into the progeny. Distorted segregations for its flanking markers showed the gene arrangement of wx-dp1-C-st1-S6. A chromosomal segment containing at least. from Wx to S6 was successfully introduced from W593 into T65wx by selecting its flanking markers during backcrossings. The introduced segment caused remarkable changes in heading time and crossability. Genetic analysis showed that the introduced segment carried En-Se1(t) whose cooperative interaction led to strong sensitivity to photoperiods such as that in the donor parent. The recombination value between En-Se1(t) and wx was estimated to be 0.07 +/ - 0.019. In addition, plants with the segment showed a low seed set when crossed as the female parent with T65wx. The low crossability was controlled by a dominant gene, Lcr1(t), from W593. Lcr1(t) was linked to wx with a recombination value of. 0.19 +/- 0.159. The results obtained were discussed in relation to the genetic differentiation on chromosome 6 among different taxa of rice.	34	WOS:A1992JT68000009	0	ORYZA-RUFIPOGON; ORYZA-SATIVA; GAMETE ELIMINATOR; PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY; CROSSABILITY	NONE	SANO, Y	1992	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

In addition to the costs of weed control, weeds account for yield losses estimated to be at least 2.2 million tons per year in sub-Saharan Africa, valued at $1.45 billion, and equating to approximately half the current total imports of rice to this region. Important weeds in upland rice include the perennial species Cyperus rotundus, Imperata cylindrica and Chromolaena odorata, the annual species Euphorbia heterophylla, Digitaria horizontalis, and the parasitic weeds Striga spp. In lowland rice the perennial weeds: Cyperus rotundus, C. esculentus and Oryza longistaminata and annual weeds Sphenoclea zeylanica, Echinochloa spp., Cyperus difformis, C. iria, Fimbristylis littoralis, Ischaemum rugosum, and O. barthii cause serious losses. Common weed management practices in rice-based cropping systems include soil tillage, clearance by fire, hand- or hoe-weeding, herbicides, flooding, fallow and crop rotations, and these are often used in combination. Labor shortages and lack of access to information, inputs, and credits are widespread constraints for African farmers. To optimize financial, social and environmental costs and benefits, integrated and ecological management approaches are advocated. Locally adapted and affordable combinations of preventive measures and interventions should be targeted. Future weed research should aim to deliver the information and tools for the implementation of these approaches. This requires the generation of knowledge on weed biology and ecology and on the consequences of changes in management and the environment on weed populations. To address the diversity of rice-based cropping systems in Africa, priorities need to be set and products and information delivered that take full account of local conditions. This will require farmer participatory approaches that are inclusive with respect to resource-poor farmers and gender.	31	WOS:000273139200005	340	NONE	ORYZA-SATIVA L.; STRIGA-HERMONTHICA SCROPHULARIACEAE; ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; DIRECT-SEEDED RICE; RHAMPHICARPA-FISTULOSA SCROPHULARIACEAE; RAIN-FED RICE; UPLAND RICE; WEST-AFRICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOWLAND RICE	Rodenburg, J.; Johnson, D.

We conducted a wide collection of Oryza species in Niger and characterize its diversity with microsatellites (or simple sequence repeats, SSR). The aims of this research were to get a better understanding of the extent of genetic diversity, its structure and partition within rice eco-geographical zones of Niger. There were 264 accessions found in farmers' and other fields: 173 O. sativa (Asia's rice), 65 O. glaberrima (Africa's rice), 25 O. barthii, and 1 O. longistaminata (weedy perennial rice), which were genotyped with 18 SSR. A total of 178 alleles were detected, with a mean of 9.89 alleles per locus. The polymorphism information content was 0.65 and heterozygosity was estimated as 0.14. Two main well-differentiate genotypic groups, which correspond to Asian and African rice species, were identified. The SSR set divided the Asia's rice group (solely indica) into irrigated and floating rice, with rainfed lowland rice in between. The African rice species group was composed of O. glaberrima, O. longistaminata and O. barthii accessions, but without any clear genetic differentiation among them likely due admixtures within the samples of O. barthii. Five accessions that could be natural interspecific hybrids were too admixed for assigning them to any of the two well-differentiated groups. The partitioning of the overall diversity showed that maximum variation was within genotypic groups and subgroups or cropping ecologies, rather than between eco-geographical zones. The eco-geographical distribution of the diversity suggests germplasm exchange in Niger. Next-steps for conserving rice and crop wild relatives in Niger could be taken using the findings of this research.	0	WOS:000330298400014	38	Conservation; Diversity; Niger; Oryza barthii; O. glaberrima; O. sativa; Rice; SSR	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; ORYZA-SATIVA L; GLABERRIMA; WILD; RUFIPOGON; EVOLUTION; INFERENCE; ORIGIN	Sow, Mounirou; Ndjiondjop, Marie-Noelle; Sido, Amir; Mariac, Cedric; Laing, Mark; Bezancon, Gilles	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE	
NONE	NONE	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY	GENETIC AND DEVELOPMENTAL BASES FOR PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IN DEEP-WATER RICE	NONE	Submergence in water induces drastic changes in the morphology of deepwater or floating rice including a rapid internodal elongation. To study the genetic and developmental bases for its phenotypic plasticity, experiments were carried out using a perennial wild rice accession with deepwater tolerance and a non-deepwater rice cultivar. Selection for deepwater tolerance was performed under 1-m deep water conditions, and backcrosses were made up to the BC5 generation to transfer a gene(s) for deepwater tolerance into the intolerant cultivar. The results indicated that a recessive gene (dw3) was responsible for deepwater tolerance, and plants with dw3 induced internodal elongation in response to submergence. Plants without dw3 showed no internodal elongation and soon died. However, the responsive ability of dw3 was markedly reduced after floral initiation, showing that the induction of internodal elongation was developmentally regulated. Submerged plants with dw3 also showed an increased number of elongated internodes, as well as nodal tillering and nodal rooting, suggesting that changes in relative timing of developmental events due to dw3 induced profound plastic responses in deepwater rice under submerged conditions.	10	WOS:A1993LG87900009	25	NONE	DEEP-WATER RICE; INTERNODAL ELONGATION; GROWTH-RESPONSE; FLOATING RICE; GIBBERELLIN; EVOLUTION; ETHYLENE; PLANTS	EIGUCHI, M; SANO, R; HIRANO, HY; SANO, Y	1993	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE	
Savanna Agr Res Inst, Tamale, Ghana	NONE	BCPC CONFERENCE - WEEDS 2001, VOLS 1 AND 2	Incidence, yield losses and some control measures for will rice in West Africa	NONE	Wild rices cause severe yield losses in the lowland rice production systems in West Africa. The annual wild rice (Oryza barthii) causes high yield losses in the irrigated rice areas, particularly in the direct seeded systems. The weed increases management costs and high levels of infestation have resulted in farmers adopting transplanting of rice in order to reduce infestations. Ability to invest in preparation of land and hand weeding before planting is however limited by commitments to production of other crops. Yield loss studies on farmers' fields indicate grain yield losses of more than 2 t/ha, or almost 40%, caused by infestations O. barthii at densities of 70 tillers/m(2). Studies identify irrigation water and the soil seed-bank as being major sources of infestation, but not nursery beds and seed supplies that are of only minor importance.; Studies on farmers' fields showed grain losses of approximately 1 t/ha, or half the yield, caused by infestations of 120 stems/m(2) of the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata. Control measures tested on farmers' fields show that applications of glyphosate to O. longistaminata at the beginning of the rainy season, or pre-plant wet cultivation, are effective means of control. Large proportions of farmers have scarce resources, which limits the likelihood of adoption in some areas. An opportunity that may be more attractive to such farmers is the development of dry season cropping of vegetables or potatoes, which produce additional revenue, as well as reducing infestations.	0	WOS:000175297500132	8	NONE	NONE	Tuor, FA; Gyasi, KO; Terbobri, P; Sarra, S; Hamadoun, A; Janowski, M; Johnson, DE	2001	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

Out of 60 random primers, which were initially screened against DNA from four individuals, 20 generated highly reproducible RAPD fragments which were then used for further population analysis. With these primers, 95 discernible DNA fragments were produced and 78 (82.1%) were polymorphic, which indicated that high levels of genetic variation existed in these natural populations. In addition, the Chinese populations showed greater polymorphism than those from Brazil at both the population and regional levels. This is noteworthy considering that the Chinese populations are from a relatively restricted area of China. The factors responsible for these findings include the contrasting mating systems in the Brazilian and Chinese populations, and gene flow from annual cultivated rice to perennial natural populations in China. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was used to apportion the variation between individuals within populations, between populations within regions, and between regions. Results showed that 61.8% of the total genetic diversity resided between the two continents, whereas only 14.9% and 23.3% was attributable to population differences within regions and to individual differences within a population, respectively. The great genetic differentiation between the Chinese and Brazilian populations is in agreement with recent treatment of the American form of O. rufipogon as a separate species, O. glumaepatula.	55	WOS:000081323900007	29	genetic variation; Oryza glumaepatula; Oryza rufipogon; RAPDs	GENETIC-VARIATION; SATIVA-L; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; GERMPLASM COLLECTION; POLYMORPHISM; MARKERS; LOCI; DIFFERENTIATION; IDENTIFICATION; ACCESSIONS	Ge, S; Oliveira, GCX; Schaal, BA; Gao, LZ; Hong, DY	1999	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

The rhizomatous trait in rice was previously shown to be quantitatively controlled by many genes, but the molecular mechanism related to rhizome development is still unknown. In the present study, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from rhizome tips of O. longistaminata were collected and analyzed. A total of 10,283 complimentary deoxyribunucleic acid clones were randomly sequenced, which generated 10,136 raw sequences, and finally, 4,419 unisequences with diverse functional categories were generated. These unisequences were mapped onto the Oryza sativa genome, which revealed that 4,285 (96.97%) and 4,151 (93.94%) of the unisequences were alignable to the japonica and indica genomic sequences, respectively, with > 80% sequence identity. Additionally, 41 unisequences showed four typical types of alternative splicing patterns. More than 600 simple sequence repeats were identified in these unisequences. A subset of unisequences were physically colocalized onto rhizome-related quantitative trait locus intervals in rice and sorghum, and one gene, OLRR1, was further confirmed to be enriched in the rhizome tip and young leaf by real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. Unisequences reported in this study provide valuable data for molecular dissection of the rhizomatous growth habit in O. longistaminata.	2	WOS:000299002400005	40	Oryza longistaminata; Rhizome; Expressed sequence tags; Unisequence	RICE GENOME; SSR-MARKERS; RNA-SEQ; SORGHUM; WILD; GENES; SEQUENCE; TRANSCRIPTOME; EXPRESSION; INDICA	Zhang, Ting; Li, Lijuan; Hu, Fengyi; Zhao, Xiuqin; Fu, Binying; Yang, Daichang	2012	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	U0836605; 2008ZX001-003

In Costa Rica, it is found in the northern region of the country, mainly in the wetland of the Medio Queso River, Los Chiles, Alajuela. It is diploid, of AA type genome and because of its genetic relatedness to cultivated rice it is included in the O. saliva complex. We describe the ultrastructure of leaf blade, spikelet, ligule and auricles. Special emphasis is given to those traits of major taxonomic value for O. glumaepatula and to those characters that distinguish this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. O. glumaepatula has a leaf blade covered with tombstone-shaped, oblong and spheroid epicuticular wax papillae. It has diamond-shaped stomata surrounded by spherical papillae, rows of zipper-like silica cells, bulky prickle trichomes of ca. 40 mu m in length and small hirsute trichomes of ca. 32 full in length. The central vein is covered with large, globular papillae of ca, 146 full in length, a characteristic that distinguishes this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. The border of the leaf blade exhibits a row of even-sized bulky prickle trichomes of ca. 42.5 mu m in length. Auricles have attenuated trichomes of ca. 5.5 mm in length on the edges and small bicellular trichomes of 120 mu m in length on the surface. The ligule has a large number of short attenuated trichomes on its surface of 100 mu m in length. These latter two traits have important taxonomic Value Since they were found in O. glumaepatula but not found in O. sativa or in O. rufipogon. The spikelet has the typical morphology of the Oryza genus. Fertile lemmas have abundant spines, a trait shared with O. rufipogon but not with O. sativa. The sterile lemmas are wing-shaped with serrated borders, a characteristic that distinguishes this species from O. rufipogon and O. sativa. All the Ultrastructure characters observed in O. glumaepatula from Costa Rica are also common to the specimens from Brazil.	3	WOS:000232593200003	18	Oryza glumaepatula; Oryza; rice; ultrastructure; anatomy; morphology; Oryzeae; Poaccae	TAXONOMIC STATUS; NEW-WORLD; AUSTRALIA; STEUD; ASIA	Sanchez, E; Espinoza, AM	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

Oryza longistaminata, a perennial wild rice with strong rhizomes, has been used as the model species for genetic and molecular dissection of rhizome development and in breeding efforts to transfer rhizome-related traits into annual rice species. In this study, an effort was taken to get insights into the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying the rhizomatous trait in O. longistaminata by comparative analysis of the genome wide tissue specific gene expression patterns of five different tissues of O. longistaminata using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array.; Results: A total of 2,566 tissue-specific genes were identified in five different tissues of O. longistaminata, including 58 and 61 unique genes that were specifically expressed in the rhizome tips (RT) and internodes (RI), respectively. In addition, 162 genes were up-regulated and 261 genes were down-regulated in RT compared to the shoot tips. Six distinct cis-regulatory elements (CGACG, GCCGCC, GAGAC, AACGG, CATGCA, and TAAAG) were found to be significantly more abundant in the promoter regions of genes differentially expressed in RT than in the promoter regions of genes uniformly expressed in all other tissues. Many of the RT and/or RI specifically or differentially expressed genes were located in the QTL regions associated with rhizome expression, rhizome abundance and rhizome growth-related traits in O. longistaminata and thus are good candidate genes for these QTLs.; Conclusion: The initiation and development of the rhizomatous trait in O. longistaminata are controlled by very complex gene networks involving several plant hormones and regulatory genes, different members of gene families showing tissue specificity and their regulated pathways. Auxin/IAA appears to act as a negative regulator in rhizome development, while GA acts as the activator in rhizome development. Co-localization of the genes specifically expressed in rhizome tips and rhizome internodes with the QTLs for rhizome traits identified a large set of candidate genes for rhizome initiation and development in rice for further confirmation.	14	WOS:000287208300001	76	NONE	RICE HOMEOBOX GENE; HALEPENSE L PERS; MADS-BOX GENE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; TRANSGENIC TOBACCO; FLOWERING TIME; LATERAL ORGANS; GROWTH HABIT; CELL FATE	Hu, Fengyi; Wang, Di; Zhao, Xiuqin; Zhang, Ting; Sun, Haixi; Zhu, Linghua; Zhang, Fan; Li, Lijuan; Li, Qiong; Tao, Dayun; Fu, Binying; Li, Zhikang	2011	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	30760094; U0836605; 2008ZX001-003

Red rice (Oryza longistaminata) is a perennial wild rice species with many valuable traits that could be used to improve cultivated rice cultivars, including rhizomatousness, disease resistance and drought tolerance. Despite these features, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that contribute to rhizome growth, development and function in this plant.; Results: We used an integrated approach to compare the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the rhizome to other tissues of red rice. 116 Gb of transcriptome sequence was obtained from various tissues and used to identify rhizome-specific and preferentially expressed genes, including transcription factors and hormone metabolism and stress response-related genes. Proteomics and metabolomics approaches identified 41 proteins and more than 100 primary metabolites and plant hormones with rhizome preferential accumulation. Of particular interest was the identification of a large number of gene transcripts from Magnaportha oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast disease in cultivated rice, even though the red rice plants showed no sign of disease.; Conclusions: A significant set of genes, proteins and metabolites appear to be specifically or preferentially expressed in the rhizome of O. longistaminata. The presence of M. oryzae gene transcripts at a high level in apparently healthy plants suggests that red rice is resistant to this pathogen, and may be able to provide genes to cultivated rice that will enable resistance to rice blast disease.	2	WOS:000335059200001	104	Transcriptomics; Proteomics; Metabolomics; Rhizome; Invasive species; Disease resistance; Rice blast; Rice	DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; DEEP-WATER RICE; CHAETOMIUM-GLOBOSUM; BLAST FUNGUS; SHOTGUN PROTEOMICS; MAGNAPORTHE-GRISEA; DISEASE RESISTANCE; HYBRID STERILITY; ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI	He, Ruifeng; Salvato, Fernanda; Park, Jeong-Jin; Kim, Min-Jeong; Nelson, William; Balbuena, Tiago S.; Willer, Mark; Crow, John A.; May, Greg D.; Soderlund, Carol A.; Thelen, Jay J.; Gang, David R.	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	IOS-1044821

The monsoon-adapted ancestors of indica-like rice were readily gathered, whether unmanaged or managed through simple burning regimes, and as such might be expected to have long been gathered or cultivated without domestication. By contrast the perennial wetland rice that was ancestral to japonica necessitated more intensive forms of management, especially in terms of water regimes, for its productivity to be increased. This encouraged water-management systems that increased in complexity and labour requirements over time and can be linked to the evolution of domestication traits in Yangzte rice between 6000 and 4000 bc. The spread of rice from its Yangzte core seems to have occurred after the development of paddy-field cultivation systems. Meanwhile in India the spread of rice out of the Ganges towards South India, mainly after 1000 bc, may also have occurred only after more intensive irrigated systems of cultivation had developed. These are inferred from the archaeological weed flora of north India to have developed during the Chalcolithic to Iron Age (after 1400 bc). We suggest that the spread of rice, which has played an important role in models of Neolithic population dispersal in Southeast Asia, may have been triggered by the development of more intensive management systems and thus have required certain social changes towards hierarchical societies rather than just rice cultivation per se.	45	WOS:000263648700006	96	Oryza sativa; cultivation; domestication; agriculture; India; China	YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA; CULTIVATED RICE; AGRICULTURAL ORIGINS; ORYZA-SATIVA; NORTH CHINA; SOUTH-ASIA; WILD-RICE; DOMESTICATION; PADDY; SITE	Fuller, Dorian Q.; Qin, Ling	2009	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

Sampling in three outbreak areas during 1994 showed that the insect's annual cycle varied according to the agroecological zone and rice cropping pattern. In the humid forest zone, Orseolia oryzivora persisted through the short dry season on ratoons of cultivated rice Oryza sativa at a rainfed site and on dry season rice crops at an irrigated one. In contrast, at rainfed sites in the moist savannah zone the pest survived the longer dry season on the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata, while ratoons and volunteers of O. sativa provided 'bridges' between the wild host and wet season rice crops. Early in the wet season at rainfed sites, galls of Orseolia oryzivora were not found at high density on wild rice, ratoons or volunteers. The heavy infestations which developed by October resulted primarily from rapid multiplication on rice crops themselves during the wet season. At all 13 sites sampled, the large majority of galls were found on fallow or cropped rice fields, rather than in ditches, bunds or uncultivated wetland, irrespective of the time of year or the hosts involved. From gall dissections, the parasitoids Aprostocetus procerae (Risbec) and Platygaster diplosisae Risbec caused over 30% mortality at some sites by October but generally increased too late to prevent crop damage. Implications of the results for the management of Orseolia oryzivora are discussed.	5	WOS:000086387600012	20	NONE	BURKINA-FASO; HARRIS; GAGNE	Williams, CT; Okhidievbie, O; Harris, KM; Ukwungwu, MN	1999	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

Using 11 sequential pollination treatments, the effects of the relative timing of pollination on the success of foreign pollen was investigated.; Foreign pollen from the crop resulted in lower pollen germination, fewer pollen tubes per style, and a significant reduction of seed set, demonstrating a disadvantage of foreign pollen even in the absence of pollen competition. When 1 : 1 pollen mixtures were applied, only 2% of the resulting seeds were hybrids, revealing a much stronger disadvantage of foreign pollen when competing with conspecific pollen. Testing the effects of the relative timing of pollination on the success of foreign pollen suggested that conspecific pollen is often more successful than foreign pollen. Nonetheless, hybridization is possible following the deposition of pollen mixtures, especially when foreign pollen arrives earlier than conspecific pollen.; Pollen competition between wild and cultivated rice could slow the rate of crop-to-wild gene flow, but even if pollen competition was ubiquitous it would not prevent gene flow from the crop.	33	WOS:000173715400010	33	Oryza rufipogon; O. sativa; pollen competition; sequential pollination; reproductive isolation	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; TUBE GROWTH; INCOMPATIBILITY; POLLINATION; SUCCESS; MARKERS; IRISES; VIGOR	Song, ZP; Lug, BR; Zhu, YG; Chen, JK	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

We examined the effect of the exotic macrophyte, para grass (Urochloa mutica ), on benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates of a tropical floodplain in northern Australia. Macroinvertebrates were sampled from four grass communities: (1) para grass, (2) hymenachne (Hymenachne acutigluma ), a native perennial; (3) rice (Oryza meridionalis ), a native annual, and (4) areas where para grass had been sprayed with herbicide.; 2. Macroinvertebrate richness, abundance and community similarity showed very few differences among the grass communities, particularly in the epiphytic habitat. Benthic invertebrates showed some differences among grasses, with lower richness and abundance and different community structure associated with hymenachne. Herbicide control of para grass had no apparent effect on benthic invertebrates but reduced the abundance of epiphytic invertebrates in the short term.; 3. The results of this study indicate that para grass has very little impact on macroinvertebrate communities, despite the changes to macrophyte communities. This is probably because para grass has similar physical structure to the native grasses and because none of these grasses contribute directly to aquatic food webs. Control of para grass using herbicide has little impact on aquatic invertebrates. This suggests that predicting the impact of weed invasion in wetlands requires an understanding of both the functional properties of macrophytes and the habitat preferences of the macroinvertebrates.	23	WOS:000182948500002	31	Australia; invasion; macroinvertebrate; weed; wetland	TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; LOWLAND STREAM; INVERTEBRATES; LAKE; VEGETATION; PREY	Douglas, MM; O'Connor, RA	2003	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

We attempted to use these polymorphic proteins to identify rice subspecies by scoring the polymorphisms. Since all japonica cultivars examined showed the same pattern of protein spots, we considered it to be a standard one with a score of zero, and the protein polymorphisms of other cultivars were given scores of 0.0, 0.5 or 1.0 according to spot density. This scoring method gave characteristic scores for indica and 'Javanica' cultivars, i.e. typical japonica cultivars selected as standards presumed the score of 0.0 whereas 'Javanica' cultivars and indica ones had the scores of 2.5-4.0 and of 5.0-8.0, respectively. By using this scoring method and the subspecies-specific proteins previously reported, 19 cultivars of unknown subspecies were classified as three indica cultivars and 16 japonica ones including four so-called 'Javanica' ones.

(Cecidomyiidae) and their derivatives has been studied for the inhibition of the shoot and root growth of rice, perennial ryegrass, cockscomb, lettuce, and cress. Almost all acetylenes generally showed growth inhibitory activity. The diacetylenes exhibited higher activity than the monoacetylenes, suggesting that a conjugated diyne segment is essential for the activity. On the other hand, the acetylenes with a nonoxidated methylene group at C-8 showed stronger activity comparing with those possessing hydroxy and acetoxy groups at C-8. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the acetylenes bearing a terminal olefinic group at C-16,C-17 enhanced the activity. It is thus clarified that important sites for the activity of the acetylenes from galls of H. rhombea are a conjugated diyne and a terminal olefinic group connecting to the aliphatic chain and that less oxidated compounds show more activity.	6	WOS:000240219700011	19	Hedera rhombea; acetylenes; structure-activity relationship	ASTERACEAE = COMPOSITAE; POLYACETYLENIC COMPOUNDS; PANAX-QUINQUEFOLIUM; ROOTS; CONSTITUENTS; SUBSTANCES; GINSENG	Yamazoe, Sayumi; Hasegawa, Koji; Shigemori, Hideyuki	2006	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 rice)	NONE

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of osmopriming on drought stress tolerance of perennial rye (Secale montanum Guss.). The experiment was including four levels of seed osmopriming (0, -11, -13 and -15 MPa) and four levels of drought stress (0, -4, -8 and -12 MPa) that were imposed by polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). At all drought stress potentials, the osmopriming increased the perennial rye seed germination rate and percentage, root and shoot length. At high drought stress potential (-12 MPa) the primed seeds with -15 MPa had the greatest germination rate and percentage. Also at low drought stress potential (-4 MPa) the greatest root and shoot length was observed when the seeds were primed with -15 MPa. The root and shoot length of the primed seeds with -11, -13 and -15 MPa were not significantly different at high drought stress potential (-12 MPa). Therefore, the osmopriming can be used as a technique to improve the germination and early growth of perennial rye under drought stress.	0	WOS:000297447200063	20	Drought stress; germination; osmopriming; perennial rye; polyethylene glycol (PEG)	SEED-GERMINATION; PROGRESSION; GROWTH	Amini, Rouhollah	2011	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

These provide novel contexts in which to study source vs. sink limitations of plant productivity. This is one of the first investigations of source: sink effects on photosynthesis, seed size, and regrowth in perennial cereal crops as well as in the commercially important annual rye (Secale cereale L.). Through experimental manipulations of field-grown plants, we studied the effect of manipulations of source: sink ratio (25% decreases and 100% increases) on photosynthetic rate in perennial wheat [Triticum aestivum L. x Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) D. R. Dewey], perennial rye [S. cereale x Secale strictum (C. Presl) C. Presl subsp. strictum (syn. Secale mon-tanum Guss.)], annual wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and annual rye. We measured carbohydrate pools, seed size, and regrowth as further indices of source vs. sink limitation. Perennial wheat showed sink limitation throughout. Annual and perennial rye appeared to be colimited. Low source: sink ratios in perennial wheat and rye were associated with up to 25% higher photosynthetic rates while high source: sink ratios led to up to 20% decreases. Seed size showed more stability under source: sink manipulation in perennials than in annuals while regrowth of perennials was not affected by source sink ratio, and all three species showed more stability of seed size in response to source: sink manipulation than annual wheat. Our results are consistent with perennial cereals operating below their maximum photosynthetic capacity, in contrast to annual wheat, and following a conservative reproductive strategy. By selecting for greater sink strength in perennial wheat, breeders may be able to achieve higher rates of photosynthesis and support higher yields in this new crop.	1	WOS:000336745400024	38	NONE	ELEVATED CO2; WEIGHT RESPONSE; WINTER-WHEAT; DURUM-WHEAT; DRY-MATTER; YIELD; LEAVES; GROWTH; GRAINS; AVAILABILITY	Jaikumar, Nikhil S.; Snapp, Sieglinde S.; Flore, James A.; Loescher, Wayne	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Perennial cereal rye (PC rye) is a new crop that is being developed at the Lethbridge Research Centre for the production of silage for cattle. Its ability to compete with weeds during establishment and tolerance to herbicides for weed control was unknown. Therefore, experiments were established with PC rye, and several herbicide treatments were applied to test crop tolerance and weed control. PC rye was not injured by bromoxynil/MCPA, 2,4-D, thifensulfuron/tribenuron, fenoxaprop, clodinafop-propargyl, and tralkoxydim. Combinations of herbicides for broadleaf weed control and annual grass control usually reduced weed dry matter (DM) to < 5 g m(-2) in the establishment year. Weeds made up 20 to 36% of the total DM when herbicides were not applied. However, this level of weed content did not affect the digestibility of the forage samples or the total DM produced as weed DM compensated for reduced PC rye yield in weedy plots. Also, the presence of weeds during establishment of PC rye did not affect weed content or PC rye yields the year after establishment.	2	WOS:000175508800029	13	acid detergent fibre; digestibility; neutral detergent fibre; perennial cereal rye; weed control; yield	BROMEGRASS ESTABLISHMENT; ALFALFA; CROPS	Moyer, JR; Acharya, SN; Mir, Z	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

NONE	Perennial cereal rye (PC rye) is being developed at Lethbridge Research Centre as a new forage crop. The first Canadian cultivar of this crop (ACE-1), tested as LRC 96-1, will have the distinction of being the first North American cultivar of PC rye and the only perennial cereal crop specifically developed for forage production. PC rye was originally developed in Germany by crossing rye (Secale cereale L.) with a perennial wild rye (Secale montanum L.) and then backcrossing the F, with Secale cereale L. while selecting for a perennial nature. In field trials, ACE-1 PC rye has produced economically viable biomass yields for 3 yr under southern Alberta growing conditions. It has similar yield and quality to barley, which is grown extensively for silage in the Canadian prairies. For proper land management and adequate forage production, ACE-1 PC rye should be seeded from mid-September to mid-October in narrow (17.5 cm) rows at a seeding rate of 80 kg ha(-1). When harvested at the soft dough stage for silage it contained less crude protein (CP) and more fibre than barley; however, in vitro gas production indicates that its dry matter (DM) digestibility will be similar to that of barley. PC rye is a valuable forage crop, but it needs to be harvested earlier than the soft dough stage to obtain comparable silage quality to barley.	2	WOS:000183038500016	24	acid detergent fibre; crude protein; digestibility; neutral detergent fibre; perennial cereal rye; forage yield; seed yield	NYLON BAG DEGRADABILITY; GAS-PRODUCTION; DETERGENT FIBER; WINTER CEREALS; MANAGEMENT; DATE; DIGESTIBILITY; INVITRO	Acharya, SN; Mir, Z; Moyer, JR; Orshinsky, BR; Thomas, JE	2003	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

The physiological and ecological implications of L. racemosus seedling desiccation tolerance are that under extreme desert and unpredictable environmental conditions, the chances of seedling establishment are increased.	4	WOS:000223041600014	30	caryopsis size; desiccation tolerance; endosperm; extreme desert; Leymus racemosus; sand dune; seedling developmental stage	HORDEUM-SPONTANEUM; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; SCHISMUS-ARABICUS; REVIVAL ABILITY; YOUNG SEEDLINGS; GERMINATION; DORMANCY; CARYOPSES; STORAGE; ISRAEL	Huang, ZY; Gutterman, Y	2004	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

AND SELECTION FOR SEED SET	NONE	Different concentrations of colchicine solution (0.1% and 0.2%) and temperatures (24 and 27 degrees C) were applied to wild diploid rye and autotetraploid forms were produced. Five hundred seedlings were placed into Petri dishes for each treatment (total 2000). Cytological research was carried out on root tips of plants in C(0) and C(1) generations. Live seedling rate and tetraploid plant rate were changed by 6.4 - 37.4 % and 8.75 - 37.04%, respectively based on treatments. Plants forming the C(1) generation were determined as 68.12% tetraploid, 14.71% diploid, 16.89% aneuploid (13.35% hypoploid, 3.57% hyperploid) and 0.27% triploid. Chromosome numbers of aneuploid plants ranged between 2n=19 - 29 and it was determined that plants having a chromosome number of 2n=27 were the most common. Other aneuploid plants (2n=19 - 26) were rare. Prior to chromosome counting in the C(1) generation, the seed lots were divided into five seed Size groups (9-11 g, 11-13 g, 13-19 g, 15-17g, 17-19 g). Chromosome numbers were determined by a modification of the conventional root tip squash technique. Chromosome numbers varied with seed size. The rate of tetraploids, diploids and aneuploids were varied between 17.86-87.25%, 2.04-42.86%, 10.71-39.29 %, respectively. As the size of seed was increased, the rate of diploid and aneuploids decreased. Seed set rate, spike length and the number of spikelets in plants belonging to different generations (C(1), C(2), C(3) and C(4)) were investigated. Seed set rate was increased from 30.51% to 61.45% with the selection of plants passing over general average in respect to seed set in each generation, however, it was determined that spike length and number of spikelets decreased. The differences were generally highly significant.	0	WOS:000292018300004	34	Secale montanum Guss; colchicine; autotetraploid; aneuploid; seed set; selection	LOLIUM-PERENNE; FESTUCA-PRATENSIS; TETRAPLOID RYE; SPACED PLANTS; POPULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; MULTIFLORUM; ANEUPLOIDY; FREQUENCY; FERTILITY	Akgun, Ilknur; Tosun, Metin; Haliloglu, Kamil; Aydin, Murat	2011	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Resistance to multiple pathogens, therefore, will clearly be important in disease management. The objective of this research was to evaluate disease resistance in 10 perennial grain accessions (one to two accessions of each: perennial wheat (Thinopyrum sp. x Triticum aestivum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), perennial rye (Secale montanum), hexaploid triticale (Triticum turgidum x S. montanum), octoploid triticale (Triticum aestivum x S. montanum), tetraploid perennial rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum), and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum)) to tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), take-all (caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), wheat streak mosaic, and barley yellow dwarf, four important diseases of the Great Plains. Several of the grasses were resistant to tan spot, barley yellow dwarf, and wheat streak mosaic. Indeed, the wild grasses and perennial donors T. intermedium (including BFPMC1), T ponticum, and S. montanum, in addition to Permontra. a tetraploid perennial rye, were highly resistant to all three diseases. Additionally, the remaining grasses tested were also more resistant to tan spot than the susceptible wheat control. However. none of the 10 grass accessions appeared highly resistant to take-all, and substantial losses in biomass were observed, although such effects may be moderated under field conditions due to the potential for take-all decline in perennial plantings.	12	WOS:000232857600016	45	NONE	MOSAIC-VIRUS RESISTANCE; CULTIVAR MIXTURES; AGROPYRON INTERMEDIUM; DISEASE RESISTANCE; TAN SPOT; WHEAT; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; CROPS; SYSTEMS	Cox, CM; Garrett, KA; Cox, TS; Bockus, WW; Peters, T	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

The results show that Kentucky blue seed germination rate was the highest at 25 degrees C (40-50%), decreased significantly at 30 degrees C (23-30%) and dropped to 0 at 40 degrees C. For the Bermuda cultivars, seed germination rate was two fold higher at 30 degrees C then 25 degrees C, and reached the highest at 40 degrees C. The cool season perennial rye and Bent grass seeds germinated well between 25 and 30 degrees C. Their germination rate was significantly lower at 40 degrees C. After exposure to 38 degrees C for 2 d, the chlorophyll content decreased significantly for Bermuda cultivars, remained stable for Bent grass and perennial rye, and increased to the greatest extent for Kentucky blue. Leaf soluble protein contents increased significantly for Kentucky Blue, but remained stable for most of the other cultivars. Western blot with Hsp70 and dehydrin antibodies identified that the Bermuda cultivars had a dynamic changes in the profile of the heat and dehydration stress-related proteins. No similar changes were detected in Kenblue cultivars. High temperature induced dehydrin homolog proteins, but not the Hsp 70 in Perennial rye and Bent grass cultivars. Findings from this research can be used to differentiate cool season and warm season grass cultivars in terms of germination and survival ability under high temperature.	5	WOS:000259850600002	27	seed germination; chlorophyll content; leaf soluble protein; heat shock protein; dehydrin protein	HIGH-TEMPERATURES; RUBISCO ACTIVASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; PLANTS; SHOCK; TOLERANCE; QUALITY; MUTANTS; COWPEA; WHEAT	Zhou, Suping; Abaraha, Abraham	2007	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

In Derzhavin rye, these alleles are completely missing or extremely rare. After three winters under field conditions, Derzhavin rye plants perished, and three quarters of S. montanum plants died; as a result, S. montanum plants with the highest expression of perennial habit and winter hardiness were selected. These plants, as compared to the initial wild rye population, manifested a higher frequency of phenotypes that included the species-specific alleles of the Aad and Est1 loci.	1	WOS:A1996UC64400010	20	Secale cereale; Secale montanum; plant development; perennial habit; winter hardiness; isoenzymes	GENOME; WHEAT	Zabrodina, MV; Silis, DY; Khavkin, EE	1996	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Aspartate aminotransferase is coded for by four loci. The data fit the model where AAT 1/4 is coded by Aat 1 and Aat 4, two duplicate loci, with null and two active alleles for each locus, alleles 1 and 3 for locus Aat 1 and alleles 2 and 4 for locus Aat 4; dimeric AAT 1/4 enzyme molecules are the products of both intralocus and interloci complementation. Allele 1 of Aat 1 was the most prominent in the isoenzyme patterns of the rye species. Alleles null and 2 of Aat 4 were twice as frequent in the perennial rye accessions, including Derzhavin and Tsitsin rye, than in winter and spring rye. In contrast, allele 4 of Aat 4 was characteristic of S. cereale. Within the screened collection, locus Aat 2 was monomorphic. Among three alleles of Aat 3, allele 2 dominated isoenzyme profiles of both rye species, whereas the other two alleles were species-specific: allele 1 was characteristic of S. montanum and allele 3 was found only in S. cereale.	1	WOS:A1996UQ16000005	32	rye; Secale cereale; Secale derzhavinii; Secale montanum; aspartate aminotransferase; isoenzymes; perennial habit; polymorphism	SECALE-CEREALE L; GLUTAMATE OXALOACETATE TRANSAMINASE; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; WHEAT; GENES	Khavkin, EE; Zabrodina, MV; Silis, DY	1996	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

K. Kellogg Biological Station	Premise of the study: Few previous studies have considered how plant age affects photosynthetic physiology in herbaceous perennials or how photosynthetic capacity in annual cereals compares to perennial relatives. Newly developed perennial cereals offer novel systems for addressing these questions. Our study makes a novel contribution by considering how life history differences affect photosynthetic physiology.; Methods: In two linked field studies, we evaluated effects of life history and plant age on photosynthetic rates (A), and related biochemical, morphological, and water-relations traits, comparing 1- and 2-yr-old cohorts of perennial wheat, intermediate wheatgrass, and perennial rye to close annual relatives (wheat and rye).; Key results: Photosynthetic rates (A) were 10-50% higher in perennial cereals compared to annuals. In wheatgrass, elevated A was associated with higher carboxylation (V-C), triose phosphate utilization (TPU) and electron transport rates (J), and higher leaf soluble protein and chlorophyll. Younger wheatgrass plants maintained higher A, TPU, J, and V-C than older plants did. Perennial wheat and rye differed from annual relatives in some but not all of these parameters. Differences in stomatal limitation were not involved, while differences in stomatal conductance (g(s)) became evident under drier conditions.; Conclusions: This study demonstrates that some perennial cereal species can maintain higher midseason A than their annual crop relatives. These changes are not fully explainable by increased access to soil water and may reflect trade-offs between allocation to reproduction and to resource acquisition. We also found evidence for age-related changes in photosynthetic physiology in a herbaceous perennial plant.	1	WOS:000328255400016	60	age; annual; perennial; Poaceae; photosynthesis; Triticum; Thinopyrum; whole plant	LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; WINTER-WHEAT; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; USE EFFICIENCY; PLANTS; LEAVES; C-3; ALLOCATION	Jaikumar, Nikhil S.; Snapp, Sieglinde S.; Sharkey, Thomas D.	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Our purpose was to evaluate five year-round forage systems for their capacity to remove P from a dairy sprayfield. The soil is a Kershaw sand (thermic, uncoated Typic Quartzipsamment). Systems included bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.)-rye (Secale cereale L.) (BR), perennial peanut (Arachis glabrata Benth.)-rye (PR), corn (Zea mays L.)-forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-rye (CSR), corn-bermudagrass-rye (CBR), and corn-perennial peanut-rye (CPR). Forages were grown for five 12-mo cycles. Effluent P rates were 80,120, and 165 kg ha(-1) cycle(-1). The 5-cycle P removal was 67 kg ha(-1) cycle(-1) for BR, 54 kg ha(-1) for CBR, 52 kg for CSR, 45 kg for PR, and 43 for CPR. Removal of P by winter rye was low. There were differences in system rankings among cycles primarily due to changes in the performance of perennial forages. In the first two cycles, BR had the greatest P removal (91 kg ha(-1) cycle(-1)) due to high bermudagrass yield and P concentration. In the first cycle, P removal was lowest for PR (36 kg ha(-1)) because perennial peanut was slow to establish. In later cycles, P removal for BR declined because bermudagrass yield and P concentration declined. It increased for PR because peanut yield increased. The yield of corn in CBR, CPR, and CSR was consistently high but P concentration was modest (avg. 2.2 g kg(-1)). Sorghum produced moderate but stable yield and had low P levels (avg. 1.8 g kg(-1)). Effluent rate marginally affected the performance of most grasses. For P recovery in dairy sprayfields in northern Florida, the best warm-season forage would likely be a high yielding, persistent bermudagrass.	4	WOS:000243575400019	26	NONE	SWINE LAGOON EFFLUENT; FLORIGRAZE RHIZOMA PEANUT; TIFTON-85 BERMUDAGRASS; COASTAL BERMUDAGRASS; ELEMENT REMOVAL; REGISTRATION; NITROGEN; YIELD; QUALITY; GROWTH	Woodard, Kenneth R.; Sollenberger, Lynn E.; Sweat, Lewin A.; Graetz, Donald A.; Rymph, Stuart J.; Joo, Yongsung	2007	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

A cover crop between vine rows can mitigate wind erosion and subsequent damage to young vines. However, low rainfall, gusty winds, and sandy soils that cause significant wind erosion problems can exacerbate cover crop establishment, and cold winters can limit cover crop survival. During 1998, 175 plant accessions were screened for performance as vineyard cover crops at Prosser, Washington. Assessed attributes included percent emergence, percent vegetative cover, stand duration, and plant height. Based on that assessment, seven domestic selections and four foreign Medicago species (medics) were identified for additional evaluation in a research trial in 1999. Additionally, seven accessions and two mixes of species that met the growth criteria and had commercial availability were evaluated in a commercial, drip-irrigated vineyard near Prosser in 1999. Vine water potential and soil moisture were determined in addition to the identical growth criteria from the 1998 study. Cover crop treatments did not lead to detectable water stress in the vines (midday y = -0.84 to -1.30 MPa). However, dry soil between vine rows due to precision drip irrigation inhibited germination and establishment of legumes; therefore, grasses had better emergence rates. Of the mixed species, a grass mix (Canada) composed of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L.), pubescent wheatgrass (Elytrigia intermedia L.), and perennial rye (Lolium perenne L.; 40:40:20), depleted soil water the least and showed the least effect on vine water potential.

TN & Associates, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA	10.1897/04-645R.1	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY	Plant toxicity testing to derive ecological soil screening levels for cobalt and nickel	NONE	Phytotoxicity tests were performed to set ecological soil screening levels for cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) following the American Society for Testing and Materials international E1963-98 Standard Guide for Conducting Terrestrial Plant Toxicity Tests. Two soils (a modified artificial soil mixed with 5% organic matter, pH 5.01, and a native riverine sandy soil with 0.1% organic matter, pH 6.3) were treated with cobalt(II) chloride or nickel chloride and allowed to age for four weeks before initiating tests. Alfalfa, barley, radish, perennial rye, and brassica were used to determine the appropriate range of concentrations and to select the most sensitive plant species for definitive tests. The tests were designed to have one to three test concentrations below the 20% effects concentration (EC20), and five to six test concentrations above the EC20. Definitive tests for each chemical used two soil matrices, three plant species, and replicates at 10 nominal concentrations, including negative control. Soil chemical concentrations were determined before planting and on completion of the phytotoxicity tests. Threshold responses interpreted as the EC20 for each species endpoint were calculated from regression analyses. The geometric mean of the EC20 values (excluding emergence, mortality, and nodule numbers) for each species resulted in values of 30.6 mg/kg for Co and 27.9 mg/kg for Ni.	10	WOS:000235700600029	23	ecological soil screening level; phytotoxicity; nickel; cobalt	NONE	Kapustka, LA; Eskew, D; Yocum, JM	2006	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE	
Concord Repatriat Hosp, Dept Immunol, Sydney, NSW, Australia	NONE	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY	Preliminary criteria for the definition of allergic rhinitis: a systematic evaluation of clinical parameters in a disease cohort (I)	NONE	Background The aim of this study is to formulate criteria for the definition of allergic rhinitis. Other studies have sought to develop scoring systems to categorize the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms but it was never used for the formulation of diagnostic criteria. These other scoring systems were arbitrarily chosen and were not derived by any statistical analysis. To date, a study of this kind has not been performed.; Objective The hypothesis of this study is that it is possible to formulate criteria for the definition of allergic rhinitis. This is the first study to systematically examine and evaluate the relative importance of symptoms, signs and investigative tests in allergic rhinitis. We sought to statistically rank, from the most to the least important, the multiplicity of symptoms, signs and test results.; Methods Forty-seven allergic rhinitis and 23 normal subjects were evaluated with a detailed questionnaire and history, physical examination, serum total immunoglobulin E, skin prick tests and serum enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST).; Results Statistical ranking of variables indicated rhinitis symptoms (nasal, ocular and oronasal) were the most commonly occurring, followed by a history of allergen provocation, then serum total IgE, positive skin prick tests and positive EAST's to house dust mite, perennial rye and bermuda/couch grass. Throat symptoms ranked even lower whilst EAST's to cat epithelia, plantain and cockroach were the least important. Not all symptoms, signs and tests evaluated proved to be statistically significant when compared to a control group; this included symtoms and signs which had been considered historically to be traditionally associated with allergic rhinitis, e.g. sore throat and bleeding nose.; Conclusion In performing statistical analyses, we were able to rank from most to least important, the multiplicity of symptoms signs and test results. The most important symptoms and signs were identified for the first time, even though some of these were not included in our original selection criteria for defining the disease cohort i.e. sniffing, postnasal drip, oedematous nasal mucosa, impaired sense of smell, mouth breathing, itchy nose and many of the specific provocation factors.	21	WOS:000088994100019	36	allergic rhinitis; parameters; preliminary diagnostic criteria; statistical analyses; definition of disease	RADIOALLERGOSORBENT TEST; REAGINIC ALLERGY; VITRO DIAGNOSIS; SKIN-TESTS; SERUM IGE; ASSOCIATIONS; REACTIVITY; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY	Ng, MLS; Warlow, RS; Chrishanthan, N; Ellis, C; Walls, R	2000	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Regrowth in the barley varieties decreased strongly from heading to grain maturity. Rye generally showed stronger regrowth than barley after late cutting, but only the perennial variety 'Soperta' regenerated as many tillers at cutting as formed when harvested at the ripe grain stage. In both species, significant differences were found between varieties. The level of soluble carbohydrates reached a maximum between heading and maturity, but differences in regrowth could not be explained by such differences. Total N decreased from heading to maturity, except for perennial rye, where an increase was observed towards ripening. It is, however, uncertain whether this was an effect rather than a cause of the regrowth.	0	WOS:000075347500003	16	carbohydrates; Hordeum spontaneum; N content; tillering	ACCUMULATION; NITROGEN; PLANTS	Christiansen, JL; Jorgensen, JR; Jornsgard, B; Stolen, O	1997	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

As rhinitis often precedes asthma it is possible that effective treatment of allergic rhinitis may reduce asthma progression.; The aim of our study is to investigate history of allergic rhinitis as a risk factor for asthma and the potential effect of allergen immunotherapy in attenuating the incidence of asthma.; Hospital-referred non-asthmatic adults, aged 18-40 years between 1990 and 1991, were retrospectively followed up until January and April 2000. At the end of follow up, available subjects were clinically examined for asthma diagnosis and history of allergen specific immunotherapy, second-hand smoking and the presence of pets in the household. A total of 436 non-asthmatic adults (332 subjects with allergic rhinitis and 104 with no allergic rhinitis nor history of atopy) were available for final analyses.; The highest OR (odds ratio) associated with a diagnosis of asthma at the end of follow-up was for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis at baseline (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.1-20.0 in the model containing the covariates of rhinitis diagnosis, sex, second-hand smoke exposure, presence of pets at home, family history of allergic disorders, sensitization to Parietaria judaica; grass pollen; house dust mites; Olea europea: orchard; perennial rye; and cat allergens). Female sex, sensitization to Parietaria judaica and the presence of pets in the home were also significantly predictive of new onset asthma in the same model. Treatment with allergen immunotherapy was significantly and inversely related to the development of new onset asthma (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.86).; In the present study we found that allergic rhinitis is an important independent risk factor for asthma. Moreover, treatment with allergen immunotherapy lowers the risk of the development of new asthma cases in adults with allergic rhinitis.	59	WOS:000234891900001	44	NONE	RESPIRATORY HEALTH SURVEY; BRONCHIAL HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; ATOPIC SENSITIZATION; POLLEN IMMUNOTHERAPY; RESPONSIVENESS; SYMPTOMS; INFLAMMATION; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; RHINOCONJUNCTIVITIS	Polosa, R; Al-Delaimy, WK; Russo, C; Piccillo, G; Sarva, M	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Despite historical abundance on the Roggeveld plateau, S. strictum subsp. africanum is currently threatened with extinction. Many reasons have been given for its decline, including susceptibility to rusts.; Methods: Leaves with stem, leaf and stripe rust pustules were sampled from cultivated and naturally occurring S. shictum subsp. africanum on the farm Kanariesfontein near Sutherland. Identity of the rust pathogens was determined through infection and sequencing studies.; Results: Inoculation studies showed that stem and leaf rust collected from wild rye were avirulent on bread wheat, but virulent on Secale cereale. The stripe rust specimen was virulent on bread wheat and was identified as Puccinia striiformis race 6E16A-. Using ITS sequencing, the wild rye leaf rust specimen was confirmed as Puccinia recondita, and the stripe rust specimen as P. striiformis. ITS sequences did not distinguish between Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia graminis f. sp. secalis, respectively the causal organisms of wheat and rye stem rust. Inoculation of wild rye plants with P. graminis f. sp. tritici proved its susceptibility to stem rust races attacking wheat and triticale.; Conclusion: This study established that S. strictum subsp. africanum is a host for both rye and wheat stem rust, rye leaf rust and wheat stripe rust.

Production Systems: Effects on Soil Fertility, Tree Morphology and Foliar Nutrient Status	MSU; Michigan Christmas Tree Association	The effect of three ground covers [alfafa (Medicago sativa), Dutch white clover (Trifolium repens) and perennial rye (Lolium perenne) on soil fertility, tree morphology, and tree nutrient status in a Fraser fir-cover crop intercropping system was investigated to assess the impacts of cover crop species and management practice on the sustainability of the cropping system; Ground cover were mowed every 21 days and returned to the ground as green mulch. Parameters monitored included soil moisture, soil organic carbon and nitrogen, soil mineral nitrogen, cover crop biomass and nutrient content, and tree morphological and nutrient characteristics. Results obtained indicated that the species selection affected the amount of green manure produced and its total nitrogen and phosphorus content. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen were stable in the upper soil profile due to the relatively small quantity added with the cropping system compared to the total stock of soil C and N. Mineral nitrogen decreased over the season due to the synchrony of cover crop decomposition, mineralization and nutrient uptake by trees in the upper profile. Species selection and management practices did not affect tree relative height growth and 100-needles weight, but management practices affected relative diameter growth, indicating competition for soil moisture. Tree foliar nutrient concentrations were not significantly affected by cover species, but were much lower in some of the management practices, suggesting competition for nutrients. We conclude that careful management should be used to capitalize on cover crop benefits and avoid competition for soil nutrients and moisture.	4	WOS:000288310100006	24	cropping system; green manure; soil organic carbon; soil organic nitrogen; plantation management; soil moisture	MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; GREEN MANURE; CATCH CROP; NITROGEN; RESIDUE; CARBON; YIELD; MINERALIZATION; PHOSPHORUS; CALIFORNIA	Wilson, A.

Atopy was defined as at least 1 positive allergen-specific test. Doctor-diagnosed current asthma was assessed by questionnaire.; Results: In the United States, 56.3% of the asthma cases were attributable to atopy, and that percentage was greater among males than females, among persons in the highest education category than in lower education categories, and among persons living in highly populated metropolitan areas than in all other areas. Each allergen-specific test was strongly associated with asthma before adjustment (odds ratios varied from 2.1 to 4.5); however, after adjustment by all the allergens, only tests to cat, Alternaria, white oak, and perennial rye were independently associated with asthma. Perennial rye was inversely associated with asthma. Of the 10 allergens, a positive response to cat accounted for the highest percentage of asthma cases (29.3%).; Conclusion: About half of the current asthma cases in the US population represented by the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were attributable to atopy. Some allergen-specific skin tests were not independently associated with asthma.; Clinical implications: If atopy could be prevented or reversed, or its effect on asthma blocked, then a large percentage of asthma cases in the US population could be prevented.	89	WOS:000250973400024	22	allergens; allergic sensitization; allergy skin test; asthma; atopy; epidemiology; NHANES III; skin prick test; survey	HOUSE-DUST MITE; COMMON ALLERGENS; CAT ALLERGEN; ASSOCIATION; SENSITIZATION; POPULATION; EXPOSURE; ADOLESCENTS; REACTIVITY; CHILDHOOD	Arbes, Samuel J., Jr.; Gergen, Peter J.; Vaughn, Ben; Zeldin, Darryl C.	2007	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE	
Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA	NONE	I INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ORGANIC MATTER MANAGEMENT AND COMPOST USE IN HORTICULTURE	Effect of Cover Crop Management on Organic Matter Production and Soil Fertility in an Abies fraseri Plantation	NONE	Fraser fir (Abies fraseri) is traditionally produced in a high input intensively managed cropping system for Christmas tree production in the Midwest and Eastern United States of America. The goal of the project is to investigate the effect of three ground covers (alfafa [Medicago sativa], Dutch white clover [Trifolium repens] and perennial rye [Lolium perenne]) on the sustainability of Fraser fir Christmas tree production system. This paper reports on the effect of ground cover species and management practices on organic matter production, soil organic matter, and soil mineral nitrogen. Intercropped ground covers were mowed every 21 days, and the cut vegetation returned to the ground as green mulch. The effect of cover crop species and management practices were evaluated by quantifying the cover crop above-ground biomass production. The total amount of mineral nutrients including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were determined by chemical analyses of subsamples of materials from the cover crop biomass. The effect of cover crop on soil fertility was evaluated by monitoring changes in soil organic carbon and soil mineral nitrogen. The results indicate that cover crop species affected the amount of green manure produced and its total nitrogen and macronutrients content. Soil organic matter content was stable in the upper soil profile due to the relatively small quantities of organic matter added with the cropping system compared with the total stock of soil C. Mineral nitrogen decreased over the season due to the synchrony of cover crop decomposition, mineralization and nutrient uptake by trees in the upper profile. These results indicate that intercropping cover crops can improve soil nitrogen fertility and organic matter; however, there is strong competition for other nutrients that need to be carefully considered.	0	WOS:000343858400044	24	ground covers; green manure; cropping system; mulching; leguminous plants; Christmas tree production	SYSTEMS; NITROGEN; AGROFORESTRY; CARBON; STOCKS	Nzokou, P.; Wilson, A.

The lengths of the DNA fragments corresponding to the MADS-box motif (about 150 base pairs, bp) were similar in two rye species, and also in maize, wheat, and barley. Amplification of the K-box sequence in three classes of the MADS-box genes produced DNA fragments of varying lengths. In the agamous class, the amplicon lengths were 180, 240, 280, and 400 bp in rye, 180, 240, 280, and 340 bp in wheat, 200, 280, and 340 bp in barley, and 190, 240, 560, and 650 bp in maize. The lengths of agamouslike6 amplicons in rye, barley, and maize corresponded to 1700, 1200, and 1700 bp. In the apetala1 class, the respective rye, wheat, barley, and maize amplicons were 485, 480-490, 480-490, and 440-450 bp. Two rye species did not differ in the length of K-box amplicons in the three classes of the MADS-box genes.

Test forages included two alfalfa (31.2 and 38.3% NDF), com silage (50.2% NDF), oat forage (48.2% NDF), perennial rye (62.1% NDF), two reed canarygrasses (55.9 and 68.1% NDF), and timothy (68.2% NDF). Sources of fiber in donor cow diets were alfalfa haylage or alfalfa haylage plus either com cobs, cottonseed hulls, oat hulls, or soy hulls. In addition, the effect of filtering through sintered glass crucibles or filter paper (two replicates each) was evaluated. There were differences (P < .01) among feeds in in vitro DM digestibility, but there were no interactions (P > .05) between test forages and either source of fiber in donor diets or filtration method. There was an interaction between source of fiber in the donor diet and method of filtration (P < .01). Samples inoculated with ruminal fluid from cows fed diets with oat hulls or soy hulls had lower (P < .01) in vitro DM digestibility when filtered on crucibles than on filter paper. Filtration method did not affect (P > .05) in vitro DM digestibility of samples inoculated with ruminal fluid from other diets. The in vitro DM digestibility of samples inoculated with ruminal fluid from cows fed alfalfa haylage was less than the in vitro DM digestibility when other inocula were used. The source of fiber in the donor cow diet and filtration method can affect in vitro DM digestibility, but relative ranking of forages was unaffected by these variables.	9	WOS:A1993LB22800037	22	FIBER; FORAGES; INVITRO DIGESTIBILITY	NEUTRAL DETERGENT FIBER; RUMEN	CHERNEY, DJR; SICILIANOJONES, J; PELL, AN	1993	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Comparisons with NHANES II were also made.; Methods: In NHANES III, 10 allergens and 2 controls were tested in all subjects aged 6 to 19 years and a random half-sample of subjects aged 20 to 59 years. A wheal-based definition of a positive test response was used.; Results: In NHANES III, 54.3% of the population had positive test responses to 1 or more allergens. Prevalences were 27.5% for dust mite, 26.9% for perennial rye, 26.2% for short ragweed, 26.1% for German cockroach, 18.1% for Bermuda grass, 17.0% for cat, 15.2% for Russian thistle, 13.2% for white oak, 12.9% for Alternaria alternata, and 8.6% for peanut. Among those with positive test responses, the median number of positive responses was 3.0. Adjusted odds of a positive test response were higher for the following variables: age of 20 to 29 years, male sex, minority race, western region, old homes, and lower serum cotinine levels. For the 6 allergens common to NHANES II and III, prevalences were 2.1 to 5.5 times higher in NHANES III.; Conclusions: The majority of the US population represented in NHANES III was sensitized to 1 or more allergens.

Since current wheat cultivars lack certain traits, for example, resistance to fusarium head blight (scab), related wild grasses may be the only option for useful variability. Wide hybridization of wheat with grasses, coupled with cytogenetic manipulation of the hybrid material, has been instrumental in the genetic improvement of wheat. Chromosome engineering methodologies, based on the manipulation of pairing control mechanisms and induced translocations, have been employed to transfer into wheat specific disease and pest resistance genes from annual (e.g., rye) or perennial (e.g., Thinopyrum spp., Lophopyrum spp., and Agropyron? spp.) members of the wheat tribe, Triticeae. The advent of in situ hybridization techniques, for example, fluorescent GISH combined with Giemsa C-banding, has proved immensely useful in characterizing alien chromatin specifying resistance to various pathogens and pests. The use of DNA markers (RAPDs and RFLPs) helps to identify desirable genotypes more precisely and, thereby, facilitates gene transfer into wheat. Such markers may be particularly helpful in monitoring the introgression of alien genes in the wheat genome. In fact, several cultivars, particularly of bread wheat, contain superior traits of alien origin. The development of novel gene-transfer techniques in the past decade that allow direct delivery of DNA into regenerable embryogenic callus of wheat has opened up new avenues of alien-gene transfer into wheat cultivars. Thus, transgenic bread and durum wheats have been produced and methods of gene delivery standardized. The application of transgenic technology has not only yielded herbicide-resistant wheats, but has also helped to improve grain quality by modifying the protein and starch profiles of the grain. These in vitro approaches to gene transfer are developing rapidly, and promise to become an integral part of plant breeding efforts, However, the new biotechnological tools will complement, not replace, conventional plant breeding.	46	WOS:000082079800005	146	alien-gene transfer; fluorescent GISH; Giemsa banding; homoeologous chromosome pairing; molecular markers; transgenic bread wheat; transgenic durum wheat	BARLEY YELLOW DWARF; FERTILE TRANSGENIC WHEAT; GREEN-FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; MOLECULAR CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS; STABLY TRANSFORMED CALLUS; HEXAPLOID BREAD WHEAT; RUST RESISTANCE GENE; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L; DURUM-WHEAT	Jauhar, PP; Chibbar, RN	1999	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "rye" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of osmopriming on drought stress tolerance of perennial rye (Secale montanum Guss.). The experiment was including four levels of seed osmopriming (0, -11, -13 and -15 MPa) and four levels of drought stress (0, -4, -8 and -12 MPa) that were imposed by polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). At all drought stress potentials, the osmopriming increased the perennial rye seed germination rate and percentage, root and shoot length. At high drought stress potential (-12 MPa) the primed seeds with -15 MPa had the greatest germination rate and percentage. Also at low drought stress potential (-4 MPa) the greatest root and shoot length was observed when the seeds were primed with -15 MPa. The root and shoot length of the primed seeds with -11, -13 and -15 MPa were not significantly different at high drought stress potential (-12 MPa). Therefore, the osmopriming can be used as a technique to improve the germination and early growth of perennial rye under drought stress.	0	WOS:000297447200063	20	Drought stress; germination; osmopriming; perennial rye; polyethylene glycol (PEG)	SEED-GERMINATION; PROGRESSION; GROWTH	Amini, Rouhollah	2011	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "secale" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

In the three generations (C-1, C-2 and C-3) the percentage of cells with univalents was 18.51, 14.56 and 9.38% respectively. The percentage of cells with irregular anaphase I with univalents was 23.43, 15.93 and 7.85%, and for anaphase 11 cells it was 20.93, 16.47 and 7.16. The percentage of tetrads with micronuclei was 18.17, 14.07 and 6.17% and seed set was 27.72, 43.51 and 59.59% respectively. A negative correlation was found between seed set and the cytological characteristics investigated. The correlations among the characters investigated during meiosis division were statistically significant. Selection of vigorous plants of autotetraploid perennial rye increased seed setting by increasing the cytological balance. However, abnormalities in the early stage of meiosis division were reflected in the later stages of meiosis.	3	WOS:000250474400008	21	meiotic irregularities; seed set; tetraploid Secale montanum Guss	TETRAPLOID RYE; SELECTION; FERTILITY	Akguen, Ilknur; Tosun, Metn	2007	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "secale" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

AND SELECTION FOR SEED SET	NONE	Different concentrations of colchicine solution (0.1% and 0.2%) and temperatures (24 and 27 degrees C) were applied to wild diploid rye and autotetraploid forms were produced. Five hundred seedlings were placed into Petri dishes for each treatment (total 2000). Cytological research was carried out on root tips of plants in C(0) and C(1) generations. Live seedling rate and tetraploid plant rate were changed by 6.4 - 37.4 % and 8.75 - 37.04%, respectively based on treatments. Plants forming the C(1) generation were determined as 68.12% tetraploid, 14.71% diploid, 16.89% aneuploid (13.35% hypoploid, 3.57% hyperploid) and 0.27% triploid. Chromosome numbers of aneuploid plants ranged between 2n=19 - 29 and it was determined that plants having a chromosome number of 2n=27 were the most common. Other aneuploid plants (2n=19 - 26) were rare. Prior to chromosome counting in the C(1) generation, the seed lots were divided into five seed Size groups (9-11 g, 11-13 g, 13-19 g, 15-17g, 17-19 g). Chromosome numbers were determined by a modification of the conventional root tip squash technique. Chromosome numbers varied with seed size. The rate of tetraploids, diploids and aneuploids were varied between 17.86-87.25%, 2.04-42.86%, 10.71-39.29 %, respectively. As the size of seed was increased, the rate of diploid and aneuploids decreased. Seed set rate, spike length and the number of spikelets in plants belonging to different generations (C(1), C(2), C(3) and C(4)) were investigated. Seed set rate was increased from 30.51% to 61.45% with the selection of plants passing over general average in respect to seed set in each generation, however, it was determined that spike length and number of spikelets decreased. The differences were generally highly significant.	0	WOS:000292018300004	34	Secale montanum Guss; colchicine; autotetraploid; aneuploid; seed set; selection	LOLIUM-PERENNE; FESTUCA-PRATENSIS; TETRAPLOID RYE; SPACED PLANTS; POPULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; MULTIFLORUM; ANEUPLOIDY; FREQUENCY; FERTILITY	Akgun, Ilknur; Tosun, Metin; Haliloglu, Kamil; Aydin, Murat	2011	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "secale" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Four treatments were employed: normal row distance (NS) with low (NSAV) or high (NSEV) seed norm, and double row distance (DS) with low or high seed norm (DSAV, DSEV). In the case of NS the yield was 16.5% greater with the higher seed norm than with the lower, while the situation was the opposite for DS, where DSAV produced 21.6% higher yield than DSEV; The plant height showed the same trend as the yield for NSAV and DSAV, while there was no correlation between NSEV and DSEV The dry matter yield of Perenne ranged from 8.6 to 10.6 t/ha in 2001. DS increased the heterogeneity in the plant height.; The experiments did not reveal an unambiguous effect of the two factors on the yield.	0	WOS:000180372100002	13	Perennial rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum); green yield; plant height	NONE	Geczki, I	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "secale" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Resistance to multiple pathogens, therefore, will clearly be important in disease management. The objective of this research was to evaluate disease resistance in 10 perennial grain accessions (one to two accessions of each: perennial wheat (Thinopyrum sp. x Triticum aestivum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), perennial rye (Secale montanum), hexaploid triticale (Triticum turgidum x S. montanum), octoploid triticale (Triticum aestivum x S. montanum), tetraploid perennial rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum), and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum)) to tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), take-all (caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), wheat streak mosaic, and barley yellow dwarf, four important diseases of the Great Plains. Several of the grasses were resistant to tan spot, barley yellow dwarf, and wheat streak mosaic. Indeed, the wild grasses and perennial donors T. intermedium (including BFPMC1), T ponticum, and S. montanum, in addition to Permontra. a tetraploid perennial rye, were highly resistant to all three diseases. Additionally, the remaining grasses tested were also more resistant to tan spot than the susceptible wheat control. However. none of the 10 grass accessions appeared highly resistant to take-all, and substantial losses in biomass were observed, although such effects may be moderated under field conditions due to the potential for take-all decline in perennial plantings.	12	WOS:000232857600016	45	NONE	MOSAIC-VIRUS RESISTANCE; CULTIVAR MIXTURES; AGROPYRON INTERMEDIUM; DISEASE RESISTANCE; TAN SPOT; WHEAT; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; CROPS; SYSTEMS	Cox, CM; Garrett, KA; Cox, TS; Bockus, WW; Peters, T	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "secale" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

Aspartate aminotransferase is coded for by four loci. The data fit the model where AAT 1/4 is coded by Aat 1 and Aat 4, two duplicate loci, with null and two active alleles for each locus, alleles 1 and 3 for locus Aat 1 and alleles 2 and 4 for locus Aat 4; dimeric AAT 1/4 enzyme molecules are the products of both intralocus and interloci complementation. Allele 1 of Aat 1 was the most prominent in the isoenzyme patterns of the rye species. Alleles null and 2 of Aat 4 were twice as frequent in the perennial rye accessions, including Derzhavin and Tsitsin rye, than in winter and spring rye. In contrast, allele 4 of Aat 4 was characteristic of S. cereale. Within the screened collection, locus Aat 2 was monomorphic. Among three alleles of Aat 3, allele 2 dominated isoenzyme profiles of both rye species, whereas the other two alleles were species-specific: allele 1 was characteristic of S. montanum and allele 3 was found only in S. cereale.	1	WOS:A1996UQ16000005	32	rye; Secale cereale; Secale derzhavinii; Secale montanum; aspartate aminotransferase; isoenzymes; perennial habit; polymorphism	SECALE-CEREALE L; GLUTAMATE OXALOACETATE TRANSAMINASE; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; WHEAT; GENES	Khavkin, EE; Zabrodina, MV; Silis, DY	1996	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 "secale" not "ryegrass" not "rye-grass" not "rye grass")	NONE

The lengths of the DNA fragments corresponding to the MADS-box motif (about 150 base pairs, bp) were similar in two rye species, and also in maize, wheat, and barley. Amplification of the K-box sequence in three classes of the MADS-box genes produced DNA fragments of varying lengths. In the agamous class, the amplicon lengths were 180, 240, 280, and 400 bp in rye, 180, 240, 280, and 340 bp in wheat, 200, 280, and 340 bp in barley, and 190, 240, 560, and 650 bp in maize. The lengths of agamouslike6 amplicons in rye, barley, and maize corresponded to 1700, 1200, and 1700 bp. In the apetala1 class, the respective rye, wheat, barley, and maize amplicons were 485, 480-490, 480-490, and 440-450 bp. Two rye species did not differ in the length of K-box amplicons in the three classes of the MADS-box genes.

Rhizomes are the primary morphological feature facilitating overwintering in Sorghum species; however, underlying physiological mechanisms governing rhizome overwintering remain poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the composition of sorghum rhizomes from diverse germplasm before and after overwintering at two locations and three experimental environments. Significant positive correlations were found between rhizome overwintering and water-soluble carbohydrates, ethanol soluble carbohydrates, and fructan concentrations, while significant negative correlations were found between rhizome overwintering and both crude fat and starch. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) calibration equations were developed to quickly and efficiently predict the concentrations of each of these assimilates in rhizomes.	0	WOS:000318497700038	45	Sorghum; Perennial; NIRS; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Rhizome composition	HALEPENSE L PERS; DIFFERENTIAL COLD TOLERANCE; FREEZING TOLERANCE; GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; JOHNSON GRASS; CARBOHYDRATE; FEEDSTOCK; CULTIVARS; CROPS; SUGAR	Washburn, Jacob D.; Whitmire, David K.; Murray, Seth C.; Burson, Byron L.; Wickersham, Tryon A.; Heitholt, James J.; Jessup, Russell W.	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

This study aimed to determine the molecular and biochemical basis conferring glyphosate resistance in this species. Experiments were conducted to assess target EPSPS gene sequences and 14C-glyphosate leaf absorption and translocation to meristematic tissues.; RESULTS: Individuals of all resistant (R) accessions exhibited significantly less glyphosate translocation to root (11% versus 29%) and stem (9% versus 26%) meristems when compared with susceptible (S) plants. A notably higher proportion of the applied glyphosate remained in the treated leaves of R plants (63%) than in the treated leaves of S plants (27%). In addition, individuals of S. halepense accession R-2 consistently showed lower glyphosate absorption rates in both adaxial (10-20%) and abaxial (20-25%) leaf surfaces compared with S plants. No glyphosate resistance endowing mutations in the EPSPS gene at Pro-101-106 residues were found in any of the evaluated R accessions.; CONCLUSION: The results of the present investigation indicate that reduced glyphosate translocation to meristems is the primary mechanism endowing glyphosate resistance in S. halepense from cropping fields in Argentina. To a lesser extent, reduced glyphosate leaf uptake has also been shown to be involved in glyphosate-resistant S. halepense.

Weeds were considered the primary crop pest by 69 to 84% of farmers, depending on district. Diseases or insects were ranked first by no more than 14% of farmers and nematodes were ranked first by no more than 11%. Giant ragweed, Canada thistle, common lambsquarters, common cocklebur, and velvetleaf were considered the most problematic summer annual and perennial weeds statewide. Chickweed, horseweed, dandelion, and henbit were considered the most problematic winter annual weeds statewide. However, no weed species was listed by more than 41% of farmers statewide suggesting that relatively unique weed management problems may exist on many farms. Also, the perceived importance of most weed species varied substantially among Indiana's nine districts. For example, velvetleaf was not listed as a problematic weed by any farmers in three districts. Burcucumber was not considered a statewide problem but was listed among the top three weeds by 14 and 16% of farmers in two southern districts. This survey supports the idea that educational programs focused on weed management should be tailored to geographic regions within Indiana.	58	WOS:000233962200046	21	pests; weed rankings; winter annual; summer annual; perennial; Sorghum halepense; Sorghum bicolor; # SORVU; # SORHU	CROP-ROTATION; MANAGEMENT; TILLAGE; COMMUNITY	Gibson, KD; Johnson, WG; Hillger, DE	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

One approach involves the development of a perennial grain sorghum by crossing tetraploid Sorghum bicolor with wild S. halepense to combine high seed yield with overwintering ability via rhizome production. We grew tetraploid S. bicolor, F-1 hybrid (BC0), and two backcross generations (BC, and BC,) in a randomized block design to examine total biomass, seed yield, and allocation to plant parts within and across generations. Root, rhizome, stem and leaf, and total biomass decreased from the BC, to BC, to S. bicolor generations, whereas panicle mass, seed mass, and reproductive allocation were lowest in the BC0 generation (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Mean seed mass (g.plant(-1)) was 39.1 in the BC0, 107.3 in the BC1, 84.1 in the BC2, and 92.7 for the S. bicolor parent, which translated into yields of 171.9, 471.6, 396.7, and 407.5 g.m(-2), respectively. Reproductive allocation varied from 14.7% in BC0 to 28.9% in BC2 compared with 33.5% in S. bicolor. Mean allocation to rhizomes was 2.71% in BC0 but negligible in BC1 and BC2. There was no relationship between rhizome mass and seed mass within any generation, but there was a positive correlation between total plant mass and rhizome mass in BC0. We divided the BC0 population into four groups with respect to rhizome production and found no significant differences among the groups in plant size or seed yield. Within each generation, reproductive allocation was inversely related to culm mass. The lack of an apparent trade-off between allocation to rhizome versus allocation to seed within any generation supports the possibility of combining within a population high seed yield and production of perennating belowground organs.	25	WOS:A1994NN38200008	39	BACKCROSS; HYBRID; PERENNIAL GRAINS; REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION; RHIZOME; SEED MASS; SORGHUM BICOLOR; SORGHUM HALEPENSE	REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; L PERS; JOHNSON GRASS; LIFE-HISTORY; SIZE; POPULATION; PLANTS; COSTS; BIOLOGY; GROWTH	PIPER, JK; KULAKOW, PA	1994	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

The objective here was to evaluate the agronomic feasibility of several combinations of species and management systems for producing herbaceous biomass on sites ranging from good to marginal cropland in the Midwest region of the United States.  Of the perennial grasses and legumes investigated, switchgrass showed the most potential as a biomass species.  It requires minimum fertilizer inputs for high yield, is very persistent, and is effective in reducing soil erosion.  Sorghum double-cropped with winter annual rye was very productive but required more inputs than switchgrass.  Interseeding sorghum into perennial grasses was not a viable option, due to its great dependence on environmental variables.  Plant composition varied greatly across species but was not greatly affected by environment or management treatments.	11	WOS:A1991FY29500001	9	HERBACEOUS BIOMASS; SWITCHGRASS; SORGHUM; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES	QUALITY	CHERNEY, JH; JOHNSON, KD; VOLENEC, JJ; GREENE, DK	1991	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species. Results have possible applications to improve perennial forage and turf grasses, extend the vegetative life cycle of annual cereals, such as wheat, or control the invasiveness of highly rhizomatous weeds such as quackgrass (Elymus repens).	1	WOS:000336728600011	89	Auxin signaling; Grasses; Gravitropism; Perenniality; Phototropism; Rhizomes	PLANT-GROWTH; LINKAGE MAPS; REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; APICAL DOMINANCE; ELYTRIGIA-REPENS; LEYMUS-WILDRYES; AUXIN RESPONSE; GRAIN CROPS; RICE	Yun, Lan; Larson, Steve R.; Mott, Ivan W.; Jensen, Kevin B.; Staub, Jack E.	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

Growth performance of pigeonpea was better with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) than in association with sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. The fast and profuse growth of pigeonpea was observed after first cropping. Pigeonpea in association with groundnut gave 33.9 and 64.9% higher yield in pigeonpea equivalent from perennial pigeonpea + sorghum combinations during 1991-92 and 1992-93 respectively. Sole crop of sorghum produced highest dry matter (11.94 and 11.93 tonnes/ha during 1991-92 and 1992-93 respectively), Followed by perennial pigeonpea + sorghum systems. The yield advantages due to alley systems increased during the second year compared with first year and maximum yield advantages were (LER 1.42 to 1.84) recorded in perennial pigeonpea + groundnut systems compared with perennial pigeonpea + sorghum (LER 1.20 to 1.42) systems. The yield of sorghum and groundnut was poorer in adjacent nt to pigeonpea hedge row than in the centre of alleys.	1	WOS:A1997YH40800009	8	NONE	NONE	Newaj, R; Roy, RD; Bisaria, AK	1997	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

We quantified impacts of perennial WSGs and row crops on soil wind erodibility parameters (erodible fraction, geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates, and aggregate stability) and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration under a dedicated bioenergy crop experiment in eastern Kansas after 4 and 5 yr of management. Soil properties were measured under switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), and annual row crops including continuous corn (Zea mays L.), photoperiod sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], sweet sorghum, and grain sorghum. Perennial WSGs reduced wind erodible fraction by 1.08 to 1.16 times compared with row crops. The geometric mean diameter of dry aggregates under switchgrass and miscanthus was 2.8 to 4.5 times greater than under row crops. Dry soil aggregate stability under miscanthus and big bluestem was greater than under row crops. After 5 yr, differences in SOC concentration between WSGs and row crops were not statistically significant for the 0- to 15-cm depth. Photoperiod sensitive and sweet sorghum had greater biomass yield than WSGs. In 2011, miscanthus yielded more biomass than corn by 5.3 Mg ha(-1). Overall, growing dedicated bioenergy crops can reduce the soil's susceptibility to wind erosion but may not significantly increase SOC concentration in this region in the short term.	2	WOS:000322620600003	28	NONE	1ST 2 YEARS; AGGREGATE STABILITY; RESIDUE REMOVAL; SWITCHGRASS; PERFORMANCE; SEQUESTRATION; PRODUCTIVITY; WINDBARRIERS; EROSION; YIELD	Evers, Byron J.; Blanco-Canqui, Humberto; Staggenborg, Scott A.; Tatarko, John	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

The objective was to compare perennial weed control in and yields and economic returns from plantings of maturity group (MG) IV and V soybean cultivars grown in the field under different weed management systems (WMS) following shallow (ST) and deep (DT) fall tillage. Adjacent experiments were conducted on Tunica clay (clayey over loamy, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept) near Stoneville, MS (lat. 33degrees26'N). Weed management systems were (i) glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine]-resistant (GR) cultivars with preemergent (PRE) nonglyphosate herbicides followed by postemergent (POST) glyphosate; (ii) GR cultivars with POST glyphosate; (iii) non-GR cultivars with PRE plus POST nonglyphosate herbicides; and (iv) non-GR cultivars with POST nonglyphosate herbicides. Control of perennial redvine [Brunnichia ovata (Walt.) Shinners] declined in the ST environment when non-GR cultivars were used, but this did not result in a yield decline. Control of perennial johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.] at the end of the study period averaged <40% when non-GR cultivars were used and >93% when GR cultivars were used regardless of tillage treatment, and this was associated with lower yield. Use of PRE + POST vs. POST-only weed management sometimes resulted in lower profits regardless of fall tillage treatment. The fall tillage treatment x WMS interaction was not significant for yield or net return, which indicates that use of DT for perennial weed management is not economical.	2	WOS:000221754000018	26	NONE	CLAY SOIL; ECONOMICS; SYSTEMS; YIELD	Heatherly, LG; Spurlock, SR; Reddy, KN	2004	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

Fifteen growing crossbred heifers (JerseyxRed Sindhi) of between 7-10 months age and pre-trial average body weight of 49-50 kg were divided on the basis of weight in to three treatment groups viz. T-1-hybrid sorghum+soybean, T-2-setaria+soybean and T-3-hybrid napier+soybean in a completely randomized block design. Intercropped forages were harvested fresh, chaffed and mixed before they were offered to the heifers. Chemical composition of the herbage, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight gain and nutrient digestibility co-efficients were estimated. The herbage mixtures had crude protein (CP) content in the range of 11.87 to 13.86% and ether extract (EE) contents were 2.91 to 3.11%, respectively. The herbage mixtures were rich in minerals (ash). The gross energy (kcal/g DM) was higher in hybrid napier+soybean, while hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had lower value for gross energy. The hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures had higher contents of NDF, ADF, cellulose, lignin and silica as compared to that of hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. The heifers fed hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture had significantly (p<0.05) higher DMI g/kg W-0.75 (97.41 +/- 4.34) as compared to hybrid sorghum+soybean (88.31 +/- 2.66) and setaria+soybean (79.29 +/- 1.06) herbage mixtures. Nutrients digestibility, DCP percent, DCP intake and nitrogen balance were significantly (p<0.05) higher in the heifers fed on hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture. There was a significant (p<0.05) difference among different herbage mixtures in TDN. The heifers on setaria+soybean herbage mixture had lower average body weight gain (g/day) than those on hybrid sorghum+soybean and hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixtures. Data obtained in this experiment demonstrated that herbage mixture of hybrid napier+soybean was better than hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean herbage mixtures in the nutrition of growing heifers. It had highest nutritive value, batter digestibility co-efficients which showed better growth rate and higher feed efficiency. In ranking, hybrid napier+soybean herbage mixture was better followed by hybrid sorghum+soybean and setaria+soybean in nutritive value in the parameters studied. For future wasteland development program in humid-sub tropics of Himachal Pradesh hybrid napier and its intercropping with soybean is recommended for general adoption because of its better adaptability and higher nutritive value.	0	WOS:000178453300014	22	perennial grasses; intercropping; chemical composition; DMI; growth rate; feed efficiency; digestibility; cattle	SHEEP	Radotra, S; Katoch, BS	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

As an incremental step towards dissecting the genetics of perennialism, a segregating F4 heterogeneous inbred family derived from a cross between S. bicolor and S. propinquum was phenotyped in both field and greenhouse environments for traits related to over-wintering and rhizome formation. An unseasonably cold winter in 2011 provided high selection pressure, and hence 74.8 % of the population did not survive. This severe selection pressure for cold tolerance allowed the resolution of two previously unidentified over-wintering quantitative trait locus (QTL) and more powerful correlation models than previously reported. Conflicting with previous reports, a maximum of 33 % of over-wintering variation could be explained by above-ground shoot formation from rhizomes; however, every over-wintering plant exhibited rhizome growth. Thus, while rhizome formation is required for over-wintering, other factors also determine survival in this interspecific population. The fine mapping of a previously reported rhizome QTL on sorghum chromosome SBI-01 was conducted by targeting this genomic region with additional simple sequence repeat markers. Fine mapping reduced the 2-LOD rhizome QTL interval from similar to 59 to similar to 14.5 Mb, which represents a 75 % reduction in physical distance and a 53 % reduction in the number of putative genes in the locus.	5	WOS:000313166400014	38	Perennialism; Perenniality; Rhizomes; Sorghum; Sorghum propinquum	HALEPENSE L PERS; JOHNSON GRASS; GENES; EXPRESSION; EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY; ORIGIN; BARLEY; CROPS; RICE	Washburn, Jacob D.; Murray, Seth C.; Burson, Byron L.; Klein, Robert R.; Jessup, Russell W.	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

In S. halepense and in the majority of reported cases in L. rigidum the glyphosate resistance trait has been associated with a mechanism that reduces glyphosate translocation within plants. Here, the significant decrease in the glyphosate resistance level when resistant plants of S. halepense and L. rigidum are grown at suboptimal cool temperature conditions is reported. Copyright (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry Results Lowering temperature from 30 to 19 degrees C in S. halepense and from 19 to 8 degrees C in L. rigidum significantly reduced both plant survival and above-ground biomass produced by glyphosate-resistant plants. Thus, glyphosate resistance parameters significantly decreased when glyphosate-treated resistant plants of both species were grown under non-optimal temperature conditions. The results suggest that the resistance mechanism against glyphosate damage is less efficient at optimal growing temperatures. Conclusion It is possible to increase the control of glyphosate-resistant S. halepense and L. rigidum populations by treatment with glyphosate during growing conditions at suboptimal low temperatures. Conversely, glyphosate failure will continue to occur on glyphosate-resistant populations treated during periods of higher temperatures.(C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry	6	WOS:000313983900013	13	herbicide resistance management; resistance mechanism; resistance factor; reduced glyphosate translocation; temperature effect	TRANSLOCATION; JOHNSONGRASS; WEEDS	Vila-Aiub, Martin M.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Yu, Qin; Powles, Stephen B.	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

In Experiment B. larvae of similar weight across host plant species were selected to enable to separate the effect of weight from that of quality of the larvae. In Experiment A, the mean weight of larvae that produced cocoons varied significantly with plant species. In both experiments. the Percentage of larvae producing cocoons and mean progeny size were lower and larvae died faster on wild than cultivated host plants. Immature development time of Co. flavipes tended to be higher on wild than cultivated grasses. The proportion of female progeny was highest on maize and lowest on the two sorghum species, in Experiment A, whereas in Experiment B. the sex ratio was similar between the host plant species. Similarly, egg-load of Co. flavipes offspring was highest on maize and lowest on Napier grass in Experiment A. but it did not vary significantly between host plants in Experiment B. It is suggested that in the coastal region of Kenya. perennial wild sorghum species are vital for the survival of Co. flavipes during the dry season, when superior plant hosts such as cultivated sorghum and maize are scarce.

In Kenya, cowpea Vigna unguiculata (Walp.) is grown in combination with cereals such as maize and sorghum, perennial legumes such as pigeon peas and root crops such as cassava and sweet potatoes.  In the present investigations, field experiments were conducted to study the incidence and damage caused by Clavigralla tomentoscollis Germ. and C. shadabi, after flowering, on cowpea intercropped with maize.  It was evident from the present studies that C. tomentoscollis and C. shadabi were more prevalent on cowpea during the first season rather than during the second season.  Both species had a preference for feeding on cowpea intercropped with maize than when it was grown in pure stands.  Consequently more pod damage was recorded on cowpea planted with maize.  It was therefore concluded that this agricultural system, which is commonly practised by small-scale farmers in Kenya, is undesirable from the point of view of bug damage.	3	WOS:A1991GJ53600011	0	CLAVIGRALLA; COWPEA; 1ST CROPPING SEASON; INTERCROPPING; POD-SUCKING BUGS; 2ND CROPPING SEASON	NONE	GETHI, M; KHAEMBA, BM	1991	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 sorghum)	NONE

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae), were compared in noncrop grasses adjacent to rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields. Three farms in the Texas rice Gulf Coast production area were surveyed every 6-8 wk between 2007 and 2009 using quadrat sampling along transects. Although D. saccharalis densities were relatively low, E. loftini average densities ranged from 0.3 to 5.7 immatures per m(2) throughout the 2-yr period. Early annual grasses including ryegrass, Lolium spp., and brome, Bromus spp., were infested during the spring, whereas the perennial johnsongrass, Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers., and Vasey's grass, Paspalum urvillei Steud., were infested throughout the year. Johnsongrass was the most prevalent host (41-78% relative abundance), but Vasey's grass (13-40% relative abundance) harbored as much as 62% of the recovered E. loftini immatures (during the winter). Young rice in newly planted fields did not host stem borers before June. April sampling in fallow rice fields showed that any available live grass material, volunteer rice or weed, can serve as a host during the spring. Our study suggests that noncrop grasses are year-round sources of E. loftini in Texas rice agroecosystems and may increase pest populations.	4	WOS:000295659500007	45	Mexican rice borer; Eoreuma loftini (Dyar); sugarcane borer; Diatraea saccharalis (F.); alternate hosts	EOREUMA-LOFTINI LEPIDOPTERA; STINK BUG HEMIPTERA; VEGETATIONAL DIVERSITY; HOST PLANTS; ENEMIES HYPOTHESIS; SUGARCANE BORER; PYRALIDAE; POPULATIONS; LOUISIANA; TEXAS	Beuzelin, J.

For outbreeding forage and turf grass species like ryegrasses (Lolium spp.), such resources have yet to be developed. Here, we present a model of the perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) genome on the basis of conserved synteny to barley (Hordeum vulgare) and the model grass genome Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) as well as rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). A transcriptome-based genetic linkage map of perennial ryegrass served as a scaffold to establish the chromosomal arrangement of syntenic genes from model grass species. This scaffold revealed a high degree of synteny and macrocollinearity and was then utilized to anchor a collection of perennial ryegrass genes in silico to their predicted genome positions. This resulted in the unambiguous assignment of 3,315 out of 8,876 previously unmapped genes to the respective chromosomes. In total, the GenomeZipper incorporates 4,035 conserved grass gene loci, which were used for the first genome-wide sequence divergence analysis between perennial ryegrass, barley, Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum. The perennial ryegrass GenomeZipper is an ordered, information-rich genome scaffold, facilitating map-based cloning and genome assembly in perennial ryegrass and closely related Poaceae species. It also represents a milestone in describing synteny between perennial ryegrass and fully sequenced model grass genomes, thereby increasing our understanding of genome organization and evolution in the most important temperate forage and turf grass species.	14	WOS:000314360100001	61	NONE	FESTUCA-PRATENSIS HUDS.; BRACHYPODIUM-DISTACHYON; LOLIUM-PERENNE; MEADOW FESCUE; ASSOCIATION GENETICS; BARLEY GENOME; RICE GENOMES; ORYZA-SATIVA; LINKAGE MAP; EVOLUTION	Pfeifer, Matthias; Martis, Mihaela; Asp, Torben; Mayer, Klaus F.

X Thinopyrum spp.) and perennial rye (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum) are novel hybrid species under development as alternatives to annual cereal crops. We conducted a 2-yr field study with a split plot design to evaluate agronomic performance, including yield, phenology, and biomass production, of perennial accessions of wheat and rye, along with annual analogs. This is one of the first studies to rigorously compare agronomic performance of 2-yr-old plants to 1-yr-old plants in perennial cereals. Perennial wheat produced 1.0 to 1.6 Mg ha(-1) grain yield, 50% of annual wheat (2.7 Mg ha(-1)), while perennial rye produced 1.3 Mg ha(-1), 73% of annual rye (1.8 Mg ha(-1)). Modest yields from perennials relative to annuals reflected lower harvest index, lower yield per tiller, and less kernel mass. One-year-old and 2-yr-old perennial plants had similar seed yields, yield components, and biomass production, indicating that plant age had little effect on these parameters and older plants maintained yield potential. In contrast, phenology did vary with plant age, and showed a shift toward earlier spring growth and later flowering dates in older perennial plants. This illustrates an expanded vegetative period for regrowing plants of these perennial cereals. There appears to be potential for producing an early season forage crop from these cereals, although biomass yields were not high at this site and regrowth was not always reliable. Overall, performance of perennial rye was consistent with a viable new cereal crop. On the other hand, perennial wheat requires further selection for allocation of biomass to grain and vigorous regrowth.	5	WOS:000310767200027	40	NONE	GRASS SEED PRODUCTION; KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS; RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; GRAIN CROPS; YIELD; QUALITY; RYEGRASS	Jaikumar, N.

However, their inclusion in farming systems is limited by poor seedling vigour, thought to be associated with greater allocation of biomass to perennating organs in roots, and poor adaptation to some soils and climatic conditions in south-western Australia. For this reason, interest in other perennial options such as perennial wheat is increasing. In this research we compared early (29-day) seedling growth and root : shoot ratios for annual and perennial medics (Medicago truncatula and M. sativa), and for annual and perennial wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum x Agropyron cross). For the medics, the annual reached the 6-leaf stage after 29 days and produced more root and shoot biomass than lucerne (4-leaf stage after 29 days), but there was no difference in root : shoot ratio or depth of root growth. For wheat, there were no differences in root growth, shoot growth, or root : shoot ratio between the annual and perennial lines (Zadoks growth stages 23 and 21, respectively, after 29 days). The poor competitive performance of M. sativa seedlings relative to M. truncatula was not due to changed allocation of biomass to shoots, but was related more to seed size (2.7 and 5.0 mg, respectively). This does not seem to occur to the same extent in perennial wheat lines, suggesting that their seedling performance may be more competitive.	2	WOS:000291104200001	39	lucerne; perennial crops; secondary salinity; seedling vigour	WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; SOIL-WATER; FARMING SYSTEMS; GRAIN CROPS; LUCERNE; LEGUMES; ALFALFA; SALINITY; PASTURES; SOUTH	Ward, P.

These provide novel contexts in which to study source vs. sink limitations of plant productivity. This is one of the first investigations of source: sink effects on photosynthesis, seed size, and regrowth in perennial cereal crops as well as in the commercially important annual rye (Secale cereale L.). Through experimental manipulations of field-grown plants, we studied the effect of manipulations of source: sink ratio (25% decreases and 100% increases) on photosynthetic rate in perennial wheat [Triticum aestivum L. x Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) D. R. Dewey], perennial rye [S. cereale x Secale strictum (C. Presl) C. Presl subsp. strictum (syn. Secale mon-tanum Guss.)], annual wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and annual rye. We measured carbohydrate pools, seed size, and regrowth as further indices of source vs. sink limitation. Perennial wheat showed sink limitation throughout. Annual and perennial rye appeared to be colimited. Low source: sink ratios in perennial wheat and rye were associated with up to 25% higher photosynthetic rates while high source: sink ratios led to up to 20% decreases. Seed size showed more stability under source: sink manipulation in perennials than in annuals while regrowth of perennials was not affected by source sink ratio, and all three species showed more stability of seed size in response to source: sink manipulation than annual wheat. Our results are consistent with perennial cereals operating below their maximum photosynthetic capacity, in contrast to annual wheat, and following a conservative reproductive strategy. By selecting for greater sink strength in perennial wheat, breeders may be able to achieve higher rates of photosynthesis and support higher yields in this new crop.	1	WOS:000336745400024	38	NONE	ELEVATED CO2; WEIGHT RESPONSE; WINTER-WHEAT; DURUM-WHEAT; DRY-MATTER; YIELD; LEAVES; GROWTH; GRAINS; AVAILABILITY	Jaikumar, Nikhil S.; Snapp, Sieglinde S.; Flore, James A.; Loescher, Wayne	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 triticum)	NONE

In response to requests from farmers, the winter wheat breeding program at Washington State University has been developing perennial wheat selected from crosses between wild wheatgrass species and commonly grown annual wheat cultivars. In 2005/06, we conducted field trials of the most promising perennial wheat breeding lines derived from interspecific crosses between tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum elongatum) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Thirty-one perennial breeding lines and two annual winter wheat cultivars; were evaluated for nutritional value in the form of grain mineral concentration, multiple baking and milling quality traits, and ease of grain threshability. The objective of this study was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these post-harvest traits in the perennial wheat lines derived from these interspecific crosses. Mineral nutrient concentrations in the perennial lines were 44, 40, 24, 23, 32, 30 and 33% higher than the annual control cultivars for calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus and zinc, respectively. The annual cultivars had a higher grain mineral content per unit area of land than the perennial lines, due primarily to the higher grain yields of the annual cultivars. Compared to the annual wheat cultivars, the perennial lines produced grain with smaller seed size, lower test weight and reduced flour yield, mix time and loaf volume. Protein content was 3.5-4.5% higher in the perennial lines than in the annual cultivars. The threshability index (TI) ranged from 0.63 to 0.89 in the perennials (mu = 0.75); significantly lower than the mean TI of the annual cultivars (mu = 0.97). The significant genotype x location interaction found for TI suggests that the variation in annual precipitation positively influenced some perennial lines to express greater threshability. In addition to transferring traits important to the perennial growth habit in wheat, the wild wheatgrass species also introduced beneficial characteristics (i.e. increased protein and mineral concentration) and deleterious traits (poor threshing grain and inferior baking qualities). This research gives researchers a platform from which to direct further research and selection in the development of perennial wheat.	7	WOS:000272639000006	44	perennial grains; wheat; agroecology; yield; mineral concentration; specialty crops; protein; threshability	GRAIN CROPS; MICRONUTRIENTS; YIELD; ZINC; IRON; DOMESTICATION; AVAILABILITY; CULTIVARS; CEREALS; SYSTEMS	Murphy, Kevin M.; Hoagland, Lori A.; Reeves, Philip G.; Baik, Byung-Kee; Jones, Stephen S.	2009	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

The profitability that might be expected from perennial wheat of different types was investigated using MIDAS (Model of an Integrated Dryland Agricultural System), a bioeconomic model of a mixed crop/livestock farming system. Although perennial wheat may produce a lower grain yield and quality than annual wheat, it is expected inputs of fertiliser, herbicide and sowing costs will be lower. Perennial wheat used solely for grain production was not selected as part of an optimal farm plan under the standard assumptions. In contrast, dual-purpose perennial wheat that produces grain and additional forage during summer and autumn than annual wheat can increase farm profitability substantially (AU$20/ha over the whole farm) and 20% of farm area was selected on the optimal farm plan under standard assumptions. Forage from perennial wheat replaced stubble over summer and grain supplement at the break of season and increased farm stock numbers. The additional value added by grazing also reduced the relative yield required for perennial wheat to be profitable. This analysis suggests perennial wheat used for the dual purposes of grain and forage production could be developed as a profitable option for mixed crop/livestock producers. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There are also potential direct production benefits from reduced external inputs, providing extra grazing for livestock in mixed farming systems, as well as benefits for whole-farm management which may offset lower grain yields. In addition to universal issues of domestication and breeding of perennial wheat, specific challenges for perennial wheat in Australia's dryland systems will include tolerance of water deficit and poor soil environments, and the risks of hosting foliar pathogens over summer. Temperate perennial forage grasses could indicate the potential distribution and traits required in perennial wheat adapted to more arid environments (e.g. summer dormancy). Several Australian native and exotic perennial relatives of wheat could also provide sources of disease resistance, and tolerance of soil acidity, drought, salinity and waterlogging. Still, several farming systems could accommodate perennial wheat with inconsistent persistence in some environments. While developing perennial wheat will be challenging, there is significant opportunity in Australia for perennial wheat to diversify current cropping options. The risks may be minimised by staged investment and interim products with some immediate applications could be produced along the way.	14	WOS:000281628100001	94	breeding; farming systems; perennial grains; sustainable agriculture	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; SALT TOLERANCE; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; GRAIN CROPS; WATERLOGGING TOLERANCE; THINOPYRUM-PONTICUM; WATER-USE; LOPHOPYRUM-ELONGATUM; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST	Bell, Lindsay W.; Wade, Len J.; Ewing, Mike A.	2010	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

However, their inclusion in farming systems is limited by poor seedling vigour, thought to be associated with greater allocation of biomass to perennating organs in roots, and poor adaptation to some soils and climatic conditions in south-western Australia. For this reason, interest in other perennial options such as perennial wheat is increasing. In this research we compared early (29-day) seedling growth and root : shoot ratios for annual and perennial medics (Medicago truncatula and M. sativa), and for annual and perennial wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum x Agropyron cross). For the medics, the annual reached the 6-leaf stage after 29 days and produced more root and shoot biomass than lucerne (4-leaf stage after 29 days), but there was no difference in root : shoot ratio or depth of root growth. For wheat, there were no differences in root growth, shoot growth, or root : shoot ratio between the annual and perennial lines (Zadoks growth stages 23 and 21, respectively, after 29 days). The poor competitive performance of M. sativa seedlings relative to M. truncatula was not due to changed allocation of biomass to shoots, but was related more to seed size (2.7 and 5.0 mg, respectively). This does not seem to occur to the same extent in perennial wheat lines, suggesting that their seedling performance may be more competitive.	2	WOS:000291104200001	39	lucerne; perennial crops; secondary salinity; seedling vigour	WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; SOIL-WATER; FARMING SYSTEMS; GRAIN CROPS; LUCERNE; LEGUMES; ALFALFA; SALINITY; PASTURES; SOUTH	Ward, P.

X Thinopyrum spp.) and perennial rye (Secale cereale L. x S. montanum) are novel hybrid species under development as alternatives to annual cereal crops. We conducted a 2-yr field study with a split plot design to evaluate agronomic performance, including yield, phenology, and biomass production, of perennial accessions of wheat and rye, along with annual analogs. This is one of the first studies to rigorously compare agronomic performance of 2-yr-old plants to 1-yr-old plants in perennial cereals. Perennial wheat produced 1.0 to 1.6 Mg ha(-1) grain yield, 50% of annual wheat (2.7 Mg ha(-1)), while perennial rye produced 1.3 Mg ha(-1), 73% of annual rye (1.8 Mg ha(-1)). Modest yields from perennials relative to annuals reflected lower harvest index, lower yield per tiller, and less kernel mass. One-year-old and 2-yr-old perennial plants had similar seed yields, yield components, and biomass production, indicating that plant age had little effect on these parameters and older plants maintained yield potential. In contrast, phenology did vary with plant age, and showed a shift toward earlier spring growth and later flowering dates in older perennial plants. This illustrates an expanded vegetative period for regrowing plants of these perennial cereals. There appears to be potential for producing an early season forage crop from these cereals, although biomass yields were not high at this site and regrowth was not always reliable. Overall, performance of perennial rye was consistent with a viable new cereal crop. On the other hand, perennial wheat requires further selection for allocation of biomass to grain and vigorous regrowth.	5	WOS:000310767200027	40	NONE	GRASS SEED PRODUCTION; KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS; RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; GRAIN CROPS; YIELD; QUALITY; RYEGRASS	Jaikumar, N.

Absence of genotype x environment interactions for PSCR suggests that selection for broad adaptation of the PSCR trait across locations and years would be possible. No relationship existed between grain yield and regrowth among the lines exhibiting PSCR, indicating potential for simultaneous selection of these traits.	6	WOS:000282569600004	18	wide crosses; perennial wheat; amphiploid; bread wheat; grain yield	PERENNIAL WHEAT; SYSTEM; CROPS	Murphy, K.

The objective was to assess their capacity to regrow post-harvest and yield grain over successive years, and thereby identify characteristics common to the surviving breeding lines. Over the 3-year experimental period 61% of the 176 experimental entries demonstrated some capacity for post-harvest regrowth. Of 125 entries planted in the first two years of experimentation, 34% persisted to produce a second grain harvest in year 2. Three entries from 73 planted in 2008 persisted to produce grain in 3 successive years. In a subset of 87 entries that underwent cytogenetic analysis there was an association between regrowth ability and the presence of at least one whole genome equivalent (14 chromosomes) from the perennial donor species. If the wheat parent was a hexaploid (2n = 42), an entry required at least 56 chromosomes to achieve any substantial post-harvest regrowth. However, the presence of 56 chromosomes was no guarantee of a capacity to survive post-harvest. The morphology of the hybrid germplasm was highly variable for every trait assessed including grain yield, grain size, grain quality, harvest index, tiller height and head morphology; reflective of the diversity of pedigrees. Narrower kernels appeared to be associated with higher grain protein concentrations. Unextractable polymeric protein (UPP) correlates with rheological properties of the doughs; some of the experimental entries had very low UPP; the majority had high UPP suggesting useful flour, dough and baking properties. A high level of disease resistance was observed in the subset of entries tested for leaf, stem and stripe rust as well as wheat streak mosaic virus, indicating that further development of hybrid germplasm would be unlikely to pose an unacceptable disease threat to conventional cereal crops, particularly where amphiploids were deployed. The variability of the cohort and the presence of entries with desirable agronomic and grain quality attributes suggested a potential to breed and select for perennial wheat derivatives with commercially desirable characteristics.

A study was established in 1990 to determine NO3-N extraction ability to 300 cm; initial soil NO3-N concentrations were high (>8 mg kg(-1)). Systems included continuous alfalfa; annual rotations of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); a native-grass system [big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi Vitman) and western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii RSdb.)]; and continuous fallow. The annual rotation effectively lowered NO3-N to <2.3 mg kg(-1) in the 30- to 90-cm depth. By the 4th yr, alfalfa had reduced NO3-N concentrations to <3.8 mg kg(-1) for the 30- to 240-cm increment. The greatest NO3-N extraction benefits of alfalfa were realized in the 4th yr at a maximum soil depth of 270 cm. Subsoil NO3-N concentration increased in the continuous alfalfa between the 4th and 6th yr. Greater NO3-N extraction occurred with the native-grass treatment compared with continuous alfalfa in the 0- to 120-cm soil depth; however, similar extraction patterns existed below 120 cm. A system involving 4 yr of alfalfa followed by two wheat crops resulted in the lowest subsoil NO3-N concentration, even lower than the continuous alfalfa and native-grass systems. It was concluded that subsoil NO3-N extraction with alfalfa was maximized when alfalfa was rotated with annual crops.	14	WOS:000169091700003	42	NONE	NITRATE-NITROGEN; FERTILIZER NITROGEN; CROPPING SYSTEMS; SOIL PROFILES; ROOT-ZONE; ROTATION; MOVEMENT; QUALITY; LEGUME; SURFACE	Entz, MW; Bullied, WJ; Forster, DA; Gulden, R; Vessey, JK	2001	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Levels of crude protein (CP) and nitrate in fall forage clipped 4 yr (2002-2005), from replicated pastures of winter wheat and two PCSG pastures established in 2001 ('Jose' tall wheatgrass [Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Z.-W. Liu & R.-C. Wang], 'Manska' intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey], and one PCSG pasture established in 2002 ['Lincoln' smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss)], were compared. Forage levels of CP in PCSGs were >148 g kg(-1) dry wt., but were 21 to 37% less than that of wheat (244 3 g kg-1). Mean nitrate-N levels of wheat were 400, 1400, 4600, and 840 mg kg(-1) in 2002 through 2005, respectively. Among the PCSGs, nitrate-N did not exceed 660 mg kg(-1). The CP levels of PCSGs were often substantially less than that of wheat, but were sufficient for growth of stocker calves. Nitrate risks that sometimes occurred with wheat would make PCSGs a safer choice for pasture.	1	WOS:000281060300062	32	NONE	SOUTHERN HIGH-PLAINS; WINTER-WHEAT; GRAIN-YIELD; TALL WHEATGRASS; PLANTING DATE; NITROGEN; GROWTH	MacKown, Charles T.; Northup, Brian K.	2010	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

After harvests, ryegrass and wheat residues were subjected to four different residue management practices (i.e. ploughed, rotary hoed, mulched and burned) and three subsequent wheat crops were grown, the first succeeding wheat crop sown in 1994/95 to examine the effects of different crop residue management practices on the residual N-15 recovery by succeeding wheat crops. Total N-15 recoveries by the winter wheat and ryegrass (seed, roots and tops) were 52% and 41%, respectively. Corresponding losses of N-15 from the crop-soil systems represented by un-recovered N-15 in crop and soil were 12% and 35%, respectively. These losses were attributed to leaching and denitrification. The proportions of N-15 retained in the soil (0-400 mm depth) at the time of harvest of winter wheat and ryegrass were 36% and 24%, respectively. Although the soil functioned as a substantial sink for fertilizer N, the recovery of this residual fertilizer by subsequent three winter wheat crops was low (1-5%) and this was not affected by different crop residue management practices.	8	WOS:000175635500003	34	N-15-labelled fertilizer; N losses; N-15 recovery; perennial ryegrass; residual fertiliser; residual N-15 recovery; residue management practices; winter wheat	SOIL-NITROGEN; NEW-ZEALAND; COVER CROPS; FATE; MINERALIZATION; PASTURES; BIOMASS; GROWTH; LEGUME; LOSSES	Kumar, K; Goh, KM	2002	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Typical cultural practices effective at reducing soil- and residue-borne pathogens, such as annual crop rotations, delayed fall planting, and tillage, are not feasible in perennial systems. Consequently, soil- and residue-borne pathogens, and pathogens such as root colonizers and viruses that survive in live tissue, may increase in importance in a perennial grain crop. Resistance genes will undeniably be important defenses against disease. However, it is seldom, if ever, possible to incorporate within a single cultivar resistance to all existing and future important diseases. Furthermore. genes vulnerable to 'boom and bust' cycles are generally short-lived when deployed in monocultures. For these reasons, the use of mixtures of crop cultivars or species that vary in resistance functions will likely be an important strategy for managing diseases and pests of perennial grains. Burning of plant residue, a natural phenomenon in native perennial grass systems, may also be an effective disease management strategy. The successful implementation of these management tools may reduce or eliminate the risk that perennial grain crops will become pathogen refugia that affect neighboring annual plantings and the productivity of perennial plants.	13	WOS:000229467200005	75	perennial wheat; host diversity; mixtures; blends; polyculture; resistance; burning	WHEAT CULTIVAR MIXTURES; WINTER-WHEAT; CEPHALOSPORIUM STRIPE; PLANT-PATHOGENS; MOSAIC-VIRUS; LEAF RUST; STEM ROT; TAN SPOT; DIVERSITY; RESISTANCE	Cox, CM; Garrett, KA; Bockus, WW	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

K. Kellogg Biological Station	Premise of the study: Few previous studies have considered how plant age affects photosynthetic physiology in herbaceous perennials or how photosynthetic capacity in annual cereals compares to perennial relatives. Newly developed perennial cereals offer novel systems for addressing these questions. Our study makes a novel contribution by considering how life history differences affect photosynthetic physiology.; Methods: In two linked field studies, we evaluated effects of life history and plant age on photosynthetic rates (A), and related biochemical, morphological, and water-relations traits, comparing 1- and 2-yr-old cohorts of perennial wheat, intermediate wheatgrass, and perennial rye to close annual relatives (wheat and rye).; Key results: Photosynthetic rates (A) were 10-50% higher in perennial cereals compared to annuals. In wheatgrass, elevated A was associated with higher carboxylation (V-C), triose phosphate utilization (TPU) and electron transport rates (J), and higher leaf soluble protein and chlorophyll. Younger wheatgrass plants maintained higher A, TPU, J, and V-C than older plants did. Perennial wheat and rye differed from annual relatives in some but not all of these parameters. Differences in stomatal limitation were not involved, while differences in stomatal conductance (g(s)) became evident under drier conditions.; Conclusions: This study demonstrates that some perennial cereal species can maintain higher midseason A than their annual crop relatives. These changes are not fully explainable by increased access to soil water and may reflect trade-offs between allocation to reproduction and to resource acquisition. We also found evidence for age-related changes in photosynthetic physiology in a herbaceous perennial plant.	1	WOS:000328255400016	60	age; annual; perennial; Poaceae; photosynthesis; Triticum; Thinopyrum; whole plant	LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; WINTER-WHEAT; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; USE EFFICIENCY; PLANTS; LEAVES; C-3; ALLOCATION	Jaikumar, Nikhil S.; Snapp, Sieglinde S.; Sharkey, Thomas D.	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

A perennial dual-purpose cereal could confer additional economic and environmental benefits. We establish that, at the end of a second growth season, selected perennial cereals were able to achieve up to 10-fold greater below-ground biomass than a resown annual wheat. We review and expand the data on available, diverse, perennial, wheat-derived germplasm, confirming that perenniality is achievable but that further improvements are essential through targeted breeding. Although not yet commercially deployable, the grain yields and dry matter production of the best performing lines approach the benchmarks predicted to achieve profitability. On reviewing the genomic composition of the most promising wheat-derived perennials, we conclude that the best near-term prospect of a productive breeding program for a perennial, wheat-derived cereal will utilise a diploid, perennial donor species, and the most promising one thus far is Thinopyrum elongatum. Furthermore, the breeding should be aimed at complete wheat-Th. elongatum amphiploids, a hybrid synthetic crop analogous to triticale. We advocate the generation of many primary amphiploids involving a diversity of Th. elongatum accessions and a diversity of adapted annual wheat cultivars. Primary perennial amphiploids would be inter-crossed and advanced with heavy, early-generation selection for traits such as semi-dwarf plant height, non-shattering heads, large seed size and good self-fertility, followed by later generation selection for robust perenniality, days to flowering, grain yield, forage yield, stability of grain yield across seasons, and disease resistance.	0	WOS:000345323600007	75	NONE	TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; PARTIAL AMPHIPLOIDS; THINOPYRUM-INTERMEDIUM; INTERGENERIC HYBRID; SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; HERBAGE PRODUCTION; EASTERN AUSTRALIA; CEREAL CROPS; RYE; PASTURES	Larkin, Philip J.; Newell, Matthew T.; Hayes, Richard C.; Aktar, Jesmin; Norton, Mark R.; Moroni, Sergio J.; Wade, Len J.	2014	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

The varieties lies in perennial group gave significantly encouraging results except plant height and dry weight over annuals for above as well as below ground plant parts but we can expect the limited grains production from perennials. Among annuals, the V3 and from perennial no single variety proved to be superior for all desirable traits. Both the groups distributed most of their root mass in upper 30 cm soil layer and only a minor portion of roots was extended to 120 cm depth. Even though, the varieties from perennial group performed well for plant biomass but it is never recommended to replace annuals with perennials for grains. However, their use as forage, soil and environment conservation crop is more reliable.	0	WOS:000332593300017	23	perennial wheat; genotypes; root architecture; seedling traits	PLANT; WATER; SYSTEMS; CROPS	Ayub, Muhammad; Brook, Robert M.; Tariq, Muhammad; Nadeem, Muhammad Ather; Tahir, Muhammad	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

D., and Murray, T. D. 2013. Genetic variation of Wheat streak mosaic virus in the United States Pacific Northwest. Phytopathology 103:98-104. Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), the cause of wheat streak mosaic, is a widespread and damaging pathogen of wheat. WSMV is not a chronic problem of annual wheat in the United States Pacific Northwest but could negatively affect the establishment of perennial wheat, which is being developed as an alternative to annual wheat to prevent soil erosion. Fifty local isolates of WSMV were collected from 2008 to 2010 near Lewiston, ID, Pullman, WA, and the United States Department of Agriculture Central Ferry Research Station, near Pomeroy, WA to determine the amount of genetic variation present in the region. The coat protein gene from each isolate was sequenced and the data subjected to four different methods of phylogenetic analyses. Two well-supported clades of WSMV were identified. Isolates in clade I share sequence similarity with isolates from Central Europe; this is the first report of isolates from Central Europe being reported in the United States. Isolates in clade II are similar to isolates originating from Australia, Argentina, and the American Pacific Northwest. Nine isolates showed evidence of recombination and the same two well-supported clades were observed when recombinant isolates were omitted from the analysis. More polymorphic sites, parsimony informative sites, and increased diversity were observed in clade II than clade I, suggesting more recent establishment of the virus in the latter. The observed diversity within both clades could make breeding for durable disease resistance in perennial wheat difficult if there is a differential response of WSMV resistance genes to isolates from different clades.	0	WOS:000312754000010	39	NONE	PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; FAMILY POTYVIRIDAE; SEED TRANSMISSION; CURL MITE; RESISTANCE; AUSTRALIA; DYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION; RECOMBINATION; TRITIMOVIRUS	Robinson, Megan D.; Murray, Timothy D.	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	WNP00670

Selecting varieties that better use organic N could be important in maximizing productivity in organic and low-input systems because these varieties may access a wider pool of available nutrients. We tested amino acid-N uptake by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings over 24 h over a range of soil glycine concentrations. Wheat was grown in 5 ml pipette tips for 10 days prior to labeling with (14)C-labeled glycine. In a second experiment, uptake of amino acid-N relative to nitrate and ammonium was tested in three pre-1940 wheat varieties (Arco, Idaed, and Red Fife), three modern varieties (Alpowa, Madsen, and Zak), and one perennial wheat variety (unreleased). Glycine-N was detected in all shoots (with the exception of the lowest soil concentration) and increased with increasing soil concentration. There were few differences in uptake between individual varieties tested but seedlings of modern varieties were more efficient at capturing organic N than classic varieties. Glycine-N constituted between 3.9% and 8.1% of total N uptake over 24 h and constituted a significantly greater proportion of total N in perennial wheat than annual wheat varieties. These results show that there may be sufficient varietal differences in organic N uptake in wheat to warrant selection for this trait in breeding programs targeted to improving N use efficiency.	8	WOS:000268543400005	34	Organic farming; Amino acid uptake; Wheat varieties	AMINO-ACID BIODEGRADATION; ORGANIC NITROGEN; RHIZOSPHERE MICROORGANISMS; PLANTS; SOIL; COMPETITION; CAPTURE; ROOTS; FIELD; ARABIDOPSIS	Reeve, Jennifer R.; Smith, Jeffrey L.; Carpenter-Boggs, Lynne; Reganold, John P.	2009	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Resistance to multiple pathogens, therefore, will clearly be important in disease management. The objective of this research was to evaluate disease resistance in 10 perennial grain accessions (one to two accessions of each: perennial wheat (Thinopyrum sp. x Triticum aestivum), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), perennial rye (Secale montanum), hexaploid triticale (Triticum turgidum x S. montanum), octoploid triticale (Triticum aestivum x S. montanum), tetraploid perennial rye (Secale cereale x S. montanum), and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum)) to tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), take-all (caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), wheat streak mosaic, and barley yellow dwarf, four important diseases of the Great Plains. Several of the grasses were resistant to tan spot, barley yellow dwarf, and wheat streak mosaic. Indeed, the wild grasses and perennial donors T. intermedium (including BFPMC1), T ponticum, and S. montanum, in addition to Permontra. a tetraploid perennial rye, were highly resistant to all three diseases. Additionally, the remaining grasses tested were also more resistant to tan spot than the susceptible wheat control. However. none of the 10 grass accessions appeared highly resistant to take-all, and substantial losses in biomass were observed, although such effects may be moderated under field conditions due to the potential for take-all decline in perennial plantings.	12	WOS:000232857600016	45	NONE	MOSAIC-VIRUS RESISTANCE; CULTIVAR MIXTURES; AGROPYRON INTERMEDIUM; DISEASE RESISTANCE; TAN SPOT; WHEAT; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; CROPS; SYSTEMS	Cox, CM; Garrett, KA; Cox, TS; Bockus, WW; Peters, T	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

In vitro assays with isolates of P grisea from perennial ryegrass, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), St. Augstinegrass (Slenotaphrum secundatum), crabgrass (Digitario sanguinalis), finger millet (Eleusine coracona), wheat (Triticum aestivum), triticale (x Triticosecale rimpaui). and rice (Oryza saliva) showed positive reactions;, however, the strength of the reactions differed among isolates. Reactions were more intense with isolates from perennial ryegrass, wheat, and triticale. All P. grisea isolates from perennial ryegrass collected from various regions of the United States showed positive reactions. P. grisea was detected at antigen dilution rates of 0.5x. 0.25x, 0.13x, 0.06x, and 0.03x. Dot-blot assays with Bipolaris sorokiniana, Colletotrichum graminicola, Curvularia lunata, Microdochium nivale, Pythium aphanidermatum, Rhizoctonia solani, or Sclerotinia homoeocarpa isolated from turfgrasses were negative. In vivo assays of symptomatic leaves of perennial ryegrass plants inoculated with P. grisea also showed positive reactions, and those inoculated with B. sorokiniana, P. aphanidermatum, R. solani, or S. homoeocarpa were negative. Intensity of reaction between the monoclonal antibody and P grisea was proportional to disease severity in perennial ryegrass inoculated with P. grisea; however. there was no reaction in dot blots of leaf tissue collected during the latent period. P grisea was detected in perennial ryegrass samples from golf course fairways affected by gray leaf spot in Connecticut. Massachusetts, Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island using this procedure. The monoclonal antibody recognition system is highly sensitive to P grisea and can be used effectively for the rapid diagnosis of gray leaf spot of perennial ryegrass turf.	5	WOS:000183693400003	51	blast; disease diagnosis; immuno-detection; Magnaporthe grisea; serology	LINKED-IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY; DOT-IMMUNOBINDING ASSAY; CAMPESTRIS PV PHASEOLI; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; PHYTOPHTHORA-CINNAMOMI; RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; SURFACE-ANTIGENS; GENUS PYTHIUM; PLANT-DISEASE; VIRUS	Uddin, W; Viji, G; Schumann, GL; Boyd, SH	2003	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Treatments were applied in the first year only; they included four crop residues: white clover, perennial ryegrass, wheat and peas and four management practices: burning, ploughing, rotary hoeing and mulching. Wheat was sown every year in the plots. Half of the experiment received nitrogen fertiliser in the third year. In the first year, higher dry weights of weeds were recorded after white clover and wheat than after perennial ryegrass and peas. After white clover and wheat, dry weight of weeds was higher in the mulching treatment while ploughing reduced weeds dry weight significantly. Dry weight of weeds was not affected by crop residues in the second year but was significantly higher after the mulching treatment. The effect of nitrogen application on weed density and growth was species' specific. For example, the number of field speedwell (Veronica arvensis i,.) plants decreased while their vigour, measured as the average plant dry weight, increased when nitrogen was applied. On the other hand, wild oats (Avena fatua L.) density increase but vigour decreased in fertilised plots. The results highlight the significance of management practices in the crop-weed interaction.	0	WOS:000082398300005	19	burning; cultural weed control; integrated weed management; mulching; nitrogen fertiliser; ploughing; rotary hoeing; rotation	BROME BROMUS-TECTORUM; WINTER-WHEAT; COVER CROP; TILLAGE; GROWTH; SOIL; DECOMPOSITION; BARLEY; YIELD; STRAW	Dastgheib, F; Kumar, K; Goh, KM	1998	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

This conclusion is supported by analysis of both experimental data of the present study on wheat and perennial pasture as well as other published and unpublished field data on wheat. The discharge-depth equation (Eq. 2) fits the data of most tests with R2 values greater than 0.9. The values of the exponent-alpha in the equation varies generally between 1.0 and 3.0 depending on the type of vegetation, stem density, height, sowing pattern, stage of growth, and flow condition, and confirms that assuming a constant value (i.e., 5/3) for the exponent in the Manning equation is not appropriate. It is proposed that the discharge-depth equation is a more suitable model than the Manning equation for shallow flow, and information is provided on the range of values of parameters for hydraulic resistance in surface irrigation flows.	11	WOS:A1992HK13400001	31	NONE	VEGETATION	MAHESHWARI, BL; MCMAHON, TA	1992	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Thus, to meet the Swedish legislation of keeping arable land covered with catch crops during autumn and winter, it may be necessary to establish a catch crop in a growing winter cereal crop.; In this study, with the objective of evaluate methods for catch crop establishment in winter cereals, different dates for under-sowing winter wheat with perennial ryegrass in spring were compared. Two held experiments per year were carried out during a four-year period. In 1994, double- and single-mounted tractor wheels were added as treatments and in 1995-97, two types of seed drills were compared.; Under-sowing with ryegrass in spring had only minor effects on winter wheat yields. Only very early in weak wheat stands or very late in wheat already at stem elongation did the action of the seed drill significantly reduce yield. It was observed that the choice of drill for under-sowing might influence the wheat yield. In a dense winter wheat crop, fast emergence was important for establishment of a good catch crop. In most cases, the highest number of emerged ryegrass plants was achieved by early under-sowing, since soil water content was generally higher in early spring than in late. On sowing too early, however, soil temperature was too low for acceptable establishment. Ryegrass establishment and growth were lowest at the latest sowing dates.	3	WOS:000076296800002	17	NONE	CATCH CROP; SOIL	Stenberg, M	1998	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Fructan molecules accumulate in cell vacuoles of perennial ryegrass and wheat and are associated with abiotic stress tolerance. High levels of amino acid similarity between the fructosyltransferases responsible for fructan accumulation indicates that the), may have evolved from invertase-like ancestral genes. In this study, we have applied comparative genomics to determine the mechanisms that lead to the evolution of fructosytransferase and invertase genes in rice, perennial ryegrass, and wheat. Duplications and rearrangements have been inferred to generate variant forms of the rice invertases since divergence from a common grass progenitor. The occurrence of multiple copies of fructosyltransferase genes indicated that duplication events continued during evolution of the wheat and perennial ryegrass lineages. Further gene rearrangements were evident in perennial ryegrass genes, albeit at a reduced level compared with the rice invertases. Gene orthologs were largely static after duplication during evolution of the wheat lineage. This study details evolutionary events that contribute to fructosyltransferase and invertase gene variation in grasses.	17	WOS:000242212000003	25	fructosyltransferase; invertase; comparative genomics; gene rearrangement; genome evolution	SUCROSE-SUCROSE 1-FRUCTOSYLTRANSFERASE; CHROMOSOME BIN MAP; DRAFT SEQUENCE; LOLIUM-PERENNE; COMMON WHEAT; FRUCTAN; COLINEARITY; EVOLUTION; JAPONICA	Francki, Michael G.; Walker, Esther; Forster, John W.; Spangenberg, German; Appels, Rudi	2006	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

A survey was conducted to determine the distribution of the fungus in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Isolates of the pathogen were recovered from roots of alfalfa, winter wheat, and perennial ryegrass plants. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1, 5.8S, and ITS2 of the rDNA of the isolates from alfalfa and wheat were identical and matched the sequences of a P. sclerotioides isolate from Wyoming. The fungus was found to be widespread in both states and was detected in roots of alfalfa plants from 17 counties in Minnesota and 14 counties in Wisconsin using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. A real-time PCR assay was developed that increased sensitivity of detecting the pathogen from plant tissues and soil. The isolates from alfalfa caused disease on inoculated winter wheat plants. Although the fungus was previously found associated with roots of diseased cereal and turfgrass plants, this is the first demonstration of pathogenicity of P. sclerotioides on wheat.	6	WOS:000245863200012	21	Lolium perenne; Triticum aestivum; winterkill	BROWN ROOT-ROT; FUNGAL PLANT-PATHOGENS; PCR; USA	Larsen, J.

Lithuanian Agr Inst, LT-5051 Akademija, Lithuania	NONE	RESULTS OF LONG-TERM FIELD EXPERIMENTS IN BALTIC STATES	Effectiveness of the use of a chisel cultivator KC-5,1 in a crop rotation on a light loamy soil	NONE	Two long-term field experiments were carried out in a nine-course crop rotation of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture. The goal of the experiments was to ascertain the possibility of primary soil tillage minimisation on a soddy-gleyic light loamy soil. We investigated whether it is feasible to replace traditional soil ploughing (to the 23-25 cm depth) by tillage with a chisel cultivator KC-5.1, and determined its influence on soil physical and chemical properties, soil moisture content, weediness and crop yield.; It was revealed that different soil tillage methods did not have any influence on soil structure, aggegate stability and dry soil bulk density. During the crop vegetative growth period, soil cultivation with a chisel cultivator KC-5,1 to a depth of 20-22 cm increased soil bulk density (10-20 cm depth) by 1.46-1.48 Mgm(-3) and by 1.46-1.50 Mgm(-3) in the 20-30 cm depth, while the upper part of the soil layer was the same as in the ploughed treatment (1.42-1.45 Mgm(-3)). A difference in bulk density influenced changes in soil porosity. The total porosity was 44-46%, air-filled porosity - 27-29%. Soil moisture content was not affected when ploughing was replaced by chiselling. Soil weediness had a tendency to decrease when chiselling was followed by a stubble cultivation performed by a mouldboard plough in the autumn. Chiselling had no negative influence on soil chemical properties. Different methods of soil tillage had a different influence on the yielding capacity of crops. The yield of a crop was heavier when the soil was stubble cultivated with a moulboard plough and after that cultivated with a chisel cultivator KC-5,1 in the autumn during the nine-course crop rotation period as compared with the stubble cultivation treatments carried out with a moulboard plough and a heavy disc harrow. Soil ploughing replacing by chiselling did not reduce the yield of spring wheat, perennial grasses and winter wheat. Sugar beet and spring barley were more sensitive to the reduction of soil tillage intensity. Results revealed that on light loamy soils having a good tilth the soil reduction of soil tillage intensity can be done in the following way: soil ploughing to the 23-25 cm depth may be replaced by chiselling followed by stubble cultivation done by a mouldboard plought. These methods may be used for winter wheat, grasses and spring wheat production.	0	WOS:000177681500018	15	minimal tillage; soil physical properties; yield	NONE	Shimanskaite, D	2000	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

A field study was conducted using two wheat varieties (Bhrikuti and Sonalika) during the 2001 and 2002 wheat seasons in Rampur, Nepal, to determine the effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and chlorine fertilization on reducing spot blotch severity in wheat, and its associated increase in grain yield. Application of N alone reduced spot blotch severity by 8% in 2002. Phosphorus fertilization had no effect on spot blotch development. The balanced application of N, P, and K reduced disease severity by 15 and 22% in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Application of KCl as well as CaCl2 reduced spot blotch severity, but the former caused 11% greater reduction than the latter. The two varieties responded differently to the mineral nutrients' effect on spot blotch severity, suggesting the nutrients' importance in cultivar selection when considering the effect of soil fertility on susceptibility to foliar diseases. The lower disease severity and higher grain yield observed after the application of KCl compared to CaCl2 showed that KCl should be used on K-deficient soils in the warmer wheat growing regions of South Asia where spot blotch is a serious perennial wheat disease in intensive rice-wheat cropping systems.

It is clear that biofuels can help meet some of the increasing need for energy. Theoretically, these can be produced from a variety of biological materials, including agricultural residues (such as corn stover and wheat straw), perennial grasses, legumes, algae, and other biological materials. Currently, however, the most heavily utilized material is corn starch. Industrial fuel ethanol production in the US primarily uses corn, because it is readily converted into fuel at a relatively low cost compared to other biomass sources. The production of corn-based ethanol in the US is dramatically increasing. As the industry continues to grow, the amount of byproducts and coproducts also increases. At the moment, the nonfermentable residues (which are dried and sold as distillers dried grains with solubles - DDGS) are utilized only as livestock feed. The sale of coproducts provides ethanol processors with a substantial revenue source and significantly increases the profitability of the production process. Even though these materials are used to feed animals in local markets, as the size and scope of the industry continues to grow, the need to ship large quantities of coproducts grows as well. This includes both domestic as well as international transportation. Value-added processing options offer the potential to increase the sustainability of each ethanol plant, and thus the industry overall. However, implementation of new technologies will be dependent upon how their costs interact with current processing costs and the logistics of coproduct deliveries. The objective of this study was to examine some of these issues by developing a computer model to determine potential cost ramifications of using various alternative technologies during ethanol processing. This paper focuses specifically on adding a densification unit operation (i.e., pelleting) to produce value-added DDGS at a fuel ethanol manufacturing plant. We have examined the economic implications of pelleting DDGS for varying DDGS production rates (100-1000 tons/d) and pelleting rates (0-100%), for a series of DDGS sales prices ($50-$200/ton). As the proportion of pelleting increases, the cost of transporting DDGS to distant markets drastically declines, because the rail cars can be filled to capacity. For example, at a DDGS sales price of $50/ton, 100% pelleting will reduce shipping costs (both direct and indirect) by 89% compared to shipping the DDGS in bulk form (i.e., no pelleting), whereas at a DDGS sales price of $200/ton, it will reduce costs by over 96%. It is clear that the sustainability of the ethanol industry can be improved by implementing pelleting technology for the coproducts, especially at those plants that ship their DDGS via rail.

NONE	NONE	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE	Integrated dryland crop and livestock production systems on the Great Plains: Extent and outlook	NONE	Soil organic carbon levels have declined 24 to 60% on many Great Plains soils since initial cultivation. Integrated crop and livestock systems could help reverse this trend, therefore we examined the extent of use, the factors affecting use, and the potential for this system. The 1992 U.S. Department of Commerce data indicate that land in integrated systems is limited to less than 10% of the agricultural land. However, expiration of the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has created interest in integrated systems. Economists report that after CRP contracts expire, perennial forages and livestock systems may be the most profitable; however, a survey of growers indicates that 63% of all CRP acres will go back to crop production. Recent research in Wyoming shows that returning CRP land to production using wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow practices quickly degrades soil quality. A doubling of grazing fees would mean an 18% reduction in demand for public land, which could mean more options for CRP acreage after contract expiration. Exemplified successful systems are the Australia wheat-sheep (Ovis aries L.) system, perennial legume-wheat rotation in southern Alberta, grass community establishment on marginal Wyoming cropland, and an alternative (organic) farming system in South Dakota. Benefits include the opportunity for soil quality improvement, economic diversity, and pest control. However, tradition, lack of managerial experience, and necessary alteration in farm-ranch infrastructure may slow adoption. Generally, dryland integrated systems are agriclimatic zone specific, and represent a potential ecologically and economically sustainable form of agriculture. Scientists and producers have to identify and develop appropriate integrated systems that fit the natural resource base.	18	WOS:A1996VA31100003	30	NONE	SOIL CARBON; SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; CULTIVATION; GRASSLAND; LANDS	Krall, JM; Schuman, GE	1996	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

In an initial study fresh soil was mixed with combinations of two inorganic S levels (0 and 10 mu g S g(-1) soil) and three plant residues (wheat straw, perennial ryegrass and oilseed rape) and followed over 32 days of incubation. AS 35 S recovery was inadequate prior to day 2 and re-mineralisation of immobilised S-35 occurred after day 8 thereby invalidating the method, estimates of gross S transformation rates should be based on data sampled between days 2 and 8. In the main experiment 16 plant residues with ranges in S contents of 0.08-0.81%, C/S ratios of 50-604 and lignin content of 0.9-10.8 were mixed with soil and carrier-free 35S label. Net turnover rates varied from 58% of S in Persian clover being immobilised to 76% of S in winter cress being mineralised within 5 days of incubation. Gross S mineralisation varied from 0.9-14.9 mu g S g(-1) soil d(-1), whereas gross immobilisation only varied from 0.5 to 3.1 mu g S g(-1) d(-1). Gross S immobilisation was strongly correlated to the C/S ratio of the plant material (P < 0.001), whereas gross S mineralisation showed a weaker, but still significant, correlation with lignin content (P < 0.05). The results indicate that immobilisation may predominantly have been a biological process in response to carbon addition while early mineralisation may have been dominated by the biochemical hydrolysis of organic sulphates in the residues. If attention is paid to the various constraints and limitations, isotopic pool dilution using 35S offers a tool that may prove valuable in understanding and modelling soil S turnover.

NONE	NONE	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE	DEVELOPMENT OF A MODEL TO PREDICT FORAGE INTAKE BY GRAZING CATTLE	NONE	A mathematical model to predict daily DMI and account for effects of energy supplementation on forage intake has been developed in several stages.  A previously evaluated dynamic rumen model for sheep was adopted as the fermentation component of the intake model.  Intake was adjusted to reach a given level of DM fill, which is the sum of the concentrations of each of the dietary fractions within the rumen.  Differential equations described the rate of change of each nutrient fraction.  Genetic size scaling rules based on mature body size relationships were used to adjust rate and fill parameters of the intake model from sheep to beef cattle.  Nutrient fractions were partitioned into those that flow at the particulate passage rate vs the fluid passage rate.  Forty-two data points representing perennial ryegrass, wheat pasture and range grasses were used to parameterize and evaluate the model.  The model was relatively sensitive to the coefficient relating DMI to particulate rate of passage, the rate constant for the use of the potentially degraded fiber fraction of the forage, and to the composition constants for the amount of carbohydrate and nitrogen in the microbial mass. Relative insensitivity was observed for starch and protein nutrient use rate constants, for the coefficient relating DMI to fluid passage rate, and for constants relating to the growth of the microbial mass in the rumen.  Feed intake of grazing cattle may be predicted by mechanistic models describing various nutrients' contribution to ruminal fill.	11	WOS:A1991FW97800047	20	RUMEN; FEED INTAKE; PASSAGE RATE; DIGESTION; DYNAMIC MODELS	BLUE GRAMA RANGELAND; DIGESTA KINETICS; CV BLANCA; RUMEN; SEASON; GROWTH; MELLE	HYER, JC; OLTJEN, JW; GALYEAN, ML	1991	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

It is critical to find diverse sources of resistance to reduce yield losses caused by B/CYDVs. Psathyrostachys huashanica Keng, a perennial wheat-relative species, has been regarded as a potential germplasm resource because of its excellent performance on resistance to drought, salinity, wheat stripe rust and the take-all fungus. In this work, the susceptibility to BYDV-GAV of P. huashanica was evaluated following inoculation using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). Additionally, an aphid-transmission test was conducted for further verification of virus infection. The results indicated that BYDV-GAV could infect P. huashanica but accumulated to much lower level in inoculated leaves of P. huashanica than in the leaves of resistant wheat line Zhong 5 and the susceptible wheat line 7182. However, no BYDV-GAV particles could be detected in new leaves of inoculated P. huashanica. In this study, we first demonstrated that P. huashanica is highly resistant to BYDV-GAV and possibly has a negative effect on the movement of the viral particles from inoculated leaves to new leaves.	0	WOS:000323747800002	25	Psathyrostachys huashanica; Barley yellow dwarf virus; Resistance; Susceptibility; Wheat-relative species	THINOPYRUM-INTERMEDIUM; WHEAT; IDENTIFICATION; LINES; PAV	Song, Shuang; Tao, Ye; Zhang, Huawei; Wu, Yunfeng	2013	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	nyhyzx201303021; B07049

Treatments consisted of conventional tillage (CT) and strip tillage (ST), rye (Secale cereale L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) cover crops and a 2-yr rye-tomato rotation. Results of the first 5 yr indicated a decrease in tomato yield over time for both tillage treatments and cover crops. However, yield rebounded overall for treatments in 1992 with the highest yield in the rye-tomato rotation. We suspect this was a result of high populations of root-knot nematodes which collapsed over the winter of 1991/1992. Tomato yields were lower following wheat and perennial ryegrass than rye. In only 1 yr out of 6, strip-tillage reduced yield compared with conventional tillage. Bacterial speck/spot symptoms on foliage, although minor, were significantly greater in ST than in CT plots during the last 3 yr. No major trends in incidence and severity of bacterial and fungal diseases and of disorders of fruit were evident during the 5-yr period and neither fruit yield nor quality were significantly affected by these factors. Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne hapla Chitwood) were numerically less in the rye-tomato rotation than in other treatments; both root-knot and root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans [Cobb]) tended to be less numerous under CT than under ST. Strip-tillage is feasible for machine harvest processing tomatoes. However, we are concerned about the tendency of tomatoes grown under reduced tillage to have lower yields than those grown under conventional tillage. More work is required on the interactions of cultivars, cover crops and nematodes in soil conservation systems.	10	WOS:000074242400026	44	tomato; bacterial speck/spot; foliar diseases; root-knot nematodes; root lesion nematodes; tillage	SYRINGAE PV TOMATO; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; PRATYLENCHUS-PENETRANS; ORGANIC-MATTER; SOIL; SYSTEMS; HOSTS	McKeown, AW; Cerkauskas, RF; Potter, JW; Van Driel, L	1998	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

To assess the variation in wind erosion of surface soil in the region, the quantity of wind-eroded soil and some surface properties (vegetation cover and surface soil moisture) were concurrently measured and analyzed in six land use types during two sandstorm events in 2004. The amount of surface soil transported varied in the following order: abandoned farmland > intermediate zone of desert and rural section > active sand dunes on the edge of the desert > the country roads > film-mulched cotton plot > alfalfa. On 20 May 2004, the quantity of eroded soil in the abandoned farmland was 76.8 g cm(-2), 40 times greater than film-mulched cotton plot and the Alfalfa. When the vegetation cover was about more than 50% or the water content of soil was above 4%, the rate of sand transport was reduced. With an increase in distance, the amounts of sand transported from Taklimakan Desert to other surfaces varied exponentially. At 400 m, the amounts of sand transported declined from 30 g cm(-2) to 1 g cm(-1), and the difference was not too much among surfaces after that point. Under the vegetation cover, the amounts of sand transported from the film-mulched cotton and alfalfa plots were more than their down tuyering and increased with sampling height, but those in the abandoned farmland, intermediate zone of desert and rural section, country roads and active sand dunes on the edge of the desert were more at 20 cm and decreased with height. The quantity of eroded soil and damage from wind erosion was extremely high in the abandoned farmland, intermediate zone of desert and rural section, country roads and active sand dunes on the edge of the desert. These were the most potent sources of dust in the area of Hetian. Measures are needed to reduce wind erosion and sandstorm in Hetian, such as expanding the area under winter-wheat, planting perennial herbs and green crops, implementing protective cultivation systems, avoiding over-grazing and laying the country roads with Gobi, gravel, and asphalt.	2	WOS:000251301500021	19	the main earth's surface; soil wind erosion; during the sandstorm; Hetian	DUST STORMS; SEDIMENT	Wang Xu; Hu Yuegao; Li Shaokun; Wang Keru	2007	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

While high feeding quality of forage grasses is facilitated by repression of flowering, flowering should also be inducible to facilitate grass seed production. Consequently, the identification and characterization of the genes controlling flowering time in forage grasses, including perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), is of great interest. In this study, three candidate genes for vernalization response genes in perennial ryegrass were identified based on DNA sequence homology to TmVRN1 and TmVRN2 of diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum), and Hd1 of rice (Oryza sativa). High sequence similarity between LpVRN1 and TmVRN1, co-localization of LpVRN1 with a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for vernalization response in perennial ryegrass, synteny between map-positions of LpVRN1 and TmVRN1, mRNA expression analysis of LpVRN1 alleles during vernalization, and the correspondence between LpVRN1 mRNA expression levels and flowering time leads us to conclude that LpVRN1 is orthologous to TmVRN1 and that its function is conserved between diploid wheat and perennial ryegrass. Of the remaining two candidate genes, a putative Hd1 orthologue, LpCO, co-localized with a second QTL for vernlization response. LpCO has recently been shown to be involved in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering time. While epistasis, at the level of LpVRN1 transcription, was observed between the LpVRN1 and LpCO genomic regions, no differential expression of LpCO transcripts was observed during vernalization. While orthologous genes controlling flowering time can thus be identified, future allele sequencing efforts will reveal if causative polymorphisms are conserved across the grasses.	31	WOS:000235903600002	42	flowering time; CO; ryegrass; vernalization; VRN1; VRN2	MADS-BOX GENES; FESTUCA-PRATENSIS HUDS.; FLOWERING-TIME CONTROL; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; REPRODUCTIVE GROWTH; ALLELIC VARIATION; ARABIDOPSIS; REPRESSOR; CONSTANS; BARLEY	Andersen, JR; Jensen, LB; Asp, T; Lubberstedt, T	2006	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Treatments applied in the first year were four crop residues (white clover, perennial ryegrass, wheat or peas) each subjected to one of four management practices (burning, ploughing, rotary hoeing or mulching). These treatments were not repeated in subsequent years of the experiment. Half of the experiment received nitrogen fertilizer in the third year. Wheat was sown each year and its grain yield and total dry weight of weeds were determined. In the third year, species composition of weeds was also studied. Significant interactions were found in the first year between crop residues and management practices on weeds and wheat yield. After clover and wheat, dry weight of weeds was highest in the mulching treatment while ploughing reduced weed dry weight significantly. In the second year, dry weight of weeds was not significantly different between crop residues but was significantly higher under previous year's mulching treatment. Total dry weight of weeds was not affected by treatments in the third year but weed species were affected. The addition of nitrogen fertilizer increased the density of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) and dry weight of annual poa (Poa annua L.), field speedwell (Veronica arvensis L.) and some broadleaf weeds, but reduced the density of field speedwell, yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) and browntop (Agrostis capillaris Sibth.) and dry weight of scentless chamomile (Matricaria inodora L.). Implications of these results in designing an integrated weed management strategy for wheat in low-input systems are highlighted.	4	WOS:000080793800006	38	NONE	BROME BROMUS-TECTORUM; TILLAGE SYSTEMS; WINTER-WHEAT; COVER CROP; NITROGEN; SOIL; ROTATION; GROWTH; CORN; COMPETITION	Dastgheib, F; Kumar, K; Goh, KM	1999	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

However, lack of pairing between chromosomes of Thinopyrum and Triticum species reduces genome stability, seed set, and perenniality. Fifty-two wheat-wheatgrass amphiploids from the perennials Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey, Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey, and Thinopyrum junceum (L.) A. Love crossed with the annuals T. aestivum, Triticum turgidum L. subsp. carthlicum (Nevski) A. Love & D. Love (syn. Triticum carthlicum Nevski), and Triticum turgidum subsp. durum (Desf.) Husn, were screened for wheat stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis) and Fusarium head blight (FHB) (caused by Fusarium graminearum) reaction and evaluated for winter hardiness and perenniality. Twenty-four of 48 amphiploid lines were resistant to all stem rust races screened, including TTKSK (syn. Ug99), TRTTF, and common U. S. races. Of the 30 amphiploid lines point inoculated with F. graminearum, 21 were resistant based on the percentage of infected spikelets and the percent of visually scabby kernels. Three sources each of potentially novel stem rust and uncharacterized FHB resistance were identified and may be useful for wheat improvement. Two lines showed perenniality in Minnesota and may be valuable as cold-tolerant perennial wheat germplasm. Seven lines representing two families showed potential genetic stability based on chromosome counts and seed production.	4	WOS:000323116900019	53	NONE	ALIEN SPECIES DERIVATIVES; YELLOW DWARF VIRUS; F-SP TRITICI; THINOPYRUM-INTERMEDIUM; LEAF RUST; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; MULTICOLOR GISH; GENOME ANALYSIS; COMMON WHEAT; PCR MARKERS	Turner, M.

Doubts about the possibility of perennial grain crops rest upon two assumptions: (1) that the relationship between yield and longevity is a fixed function that cannot be influenced by selection, mutation or environmental changes; and (2) that yield and longevity trade off in a bivariate manner to the exclusion of all other traits. These assumptions are consistent with the phenotypic trade-off model, but recent research suggests that a quantitative genetic model is a more appropriate approach to trade-offs. In the quantitative genetic model, environmental and genetic changes can result in increases in two traits simultaneously even when a trade-off, or negative correlation, exists between the two traits. Empirical evidence that the trade-off between perenniality and reproductive allocation is not fixed comes from wild, herbaceous perennials that can produce more than 2000 kg seed ha(-1) in the temperate zone, and herbaceous perennial crops that produce on average 8900 kg fruit ha(-1) in the tropics. Ecological literature suggests that most perennials produce small amounts of seed relative to their vegetative growth not as a physiological absolute, but rather as a result of natural selection in a stable, competitive environment favoring longevity. By selecting strongly for seed yield in a population of perennial plants, the plant breeder can likely achieve that which is rare in nature-a high seed-yielding perennial plant. The same general methodologies that have allowed annual grain breeders to increase grain yield and push many combinations of negatively correlated traits to levels of expression not seen in nature are available to the perennial grain breeder. Perennial,rain breeders are integrating ecological principles and traditional plant breeding methods in their efforts to develop perennial grain wheat (Triticum spp.), sorghum (Sorghum spp.), sunflower (Helianthus spp.), Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis) and rice (Oryza spp.).	40	WOS:000229467200004	39	trade-off. carbon allocation; perenniality; life history; plant domestication	RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; RECURRENT SELECTION; FORAGE QUALITY; TRADE-OFFS; SEED YIELD; EVOLUTION; WHEAT; PLASTICITY; ALFALFA; TRAITS	DeHaan, LR; Van Tassel, DL; Cox, TS	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

In perennial ryegrass, the putative defence activator Bion was also tested. Resistance was measured as regrowth of plants after inoculation with M. nivale and incubation in darkness at 2degreesC. In winter wheat, pre-treatment with chitosan at 1000 mug per plant increased resistance to subsequent infection by M. nivale, but this effect was less significant in a replicate experiment. Chitosan-treated winter wheat plants expressed the gene for the pathogenesis-related protein chitinase at higher levels than non-treated plants. Chitinase gene expression was also stimulated by M. nivale infection in winter wheat. Perennial ryegrass pre-treated with Bion or chitosan and inoculated with M. nivale did not display better regrowth after incubation than non-treated, inoculated plants. Rather, regrowth was reduced in some of the Bion-treated plants after incubation. We speculate that the cost or the mechanism of induced resistance makes Bion non-effective in plants that are not actively growing. Bion at concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 mug active ingredient per ml, and the highest concentration of chitosan used (2000 mug per ml) reduced in vitro growth of the pathogen, suggesting that both defence activators possess antifungal activity.	5	WOS:000226898600008	72	benzothiadiazole; benzo-(1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid-S-methyl ester; induced resistance; Lolium perenne; Triticum aestivum	SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE; PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS; F-SP TRITICI; MICRODOCHIUM-NIVALE; LOW-TEMPERATURE; ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY; SALICYLIC-ACID; TYPHULA-ISHIKARIENSIS; BIPOLARIS-SOROKINIANA; RADICIS-LYCOPERSICI	Hofgaard, IS; Ergon, A; Wanner, LA; Tronsmo, AM	2005	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

Enzymes that contribute to this industry remain of critical value in new and established markets as commodity additives and for in planta production. A transition to non-food feedstocks is both desirable and essential to enable larger scale production. This objective would relieve dependence on foreign oil and strengthen the national economy. Feedstocks derived from corn stover, wheat straw, perennial grasses and timber require pretreatment to increase the accessibility of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic substrates to commodity enzymes for saccharification, which is followed by fermentation-based conversion of monosaccharides to ethanol. Hot acid pretreatment is the industrial standard method used to achieve deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, enzymes that tolerate both acid and heat may contribute toward the improvement of lignocellulosic biomass processing. These enzymes are produced naturally by extremely thermophilic microbes, sometimes called extremophiles. This review summarizes information on enzymes from selected (acido)thermophiles that mediate saccharification of - and ss-linked carbohydrates of relevance to biomass processing.	11	WOS:000278781700016	56	extremophile; thermophile; glycosyl hydrolase; endoglucanase; cellobiohydrolase; starch; cellulose; biomass; Sulfolobus; Pyrococcus; Thermotoga	ARCHAEON SULFOLOBUS-SOLFATARICUS; ARCHAEBACTERIUM PYROCOCCUS-FURIOSUS; ALPHA-AMYLASE; ALICYCLOBACILLUS-ACIDOCALDARIUS; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; BACILLUS-ACIDOCALDARIUS; GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASES; XYLANASE ACTIVITY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; GENE CLONING	Miller, P.

STS critiques of determinism are needed in studies of agricultural technology. However, we contend that focusing on the agency of end users may mask the role of political-economic factors which influence technology developments and applications. This paper seeks to mesh STS insights with political-economic perspectives by accounting for relationships between availability of diverse technologies, variations in political-economic structures, and farmer interests and characteristics. We present the results of an analysis on the recent development of three wheat varieties: (a) a wheat variety that was modified genetically to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate, (b) wheat varieties with characteristics selected to serve specific markets, (c) and emerging research and development of perennial wheat varieties. Using data obtained through a survey of wheat growers in Washington State, we analyzed whether farmer interest in these three clusters of wheat varieties was associated with distinct individual characteristics and attitudes and whether those characteristics and attitudes are consistent with political economic structures. Although our analysis did not allow us to assess the degree of direct influence that farmers have on the technological development trajectory for these types of wheat, we were able to document variation in technological alternatives and farmer characteristics related to different political-economic trends.	5	WOS:000290667800005	41	Farming; Genetically modified; Niche marketing; Participatory; Technological determinism	UNITED-STATES; UNIVERSITY; FORDISM; SYSTEM; WORK	Glenna, Leland L.; Jussaume, Raymond A., Jr.; Dawson, Julie C.	2011	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

In an Orthic Brown Chernozem in southwestern Saskatchewan, 7 years of no-till cereal-fallow, imposed on a long-term tillage fallow-wheat rotation soil, resulted in 0.1 Mg C ha(-1) more organic C mass in the sand + organic matter (OM) fraction of the 0- to 5-cm layer, whereas organic C associated with coarse silt (CS), fine silt (FS), coarse clay, and fine clay of 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm layers was less than that of the comparable tilled cereal-fallow system. Conversion of tilled fallow-wheat rotation soil to continuous cropping had a slight effect, whereas the organic C mass in all the size fractions was significantly increased in both 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm layers after alfalfa was introduced on tilled fallow-wheat as perennial forage for 10 years. In an Orthic Black Chernozem in east-central Saskatchewan that was cultivated and tilled using a cereal-fallow rotation for 62 years, organic C mass decreased in sand + OM, CS, and FS of 0- to 10-cm depth. Conversion of the tilled cereal-fallow cropland soil back to seeded grassland resulted in significantly more soil organic C in sand + OM fraction after 12 years of grass seed-down. The sand + OM fraction appears to be the size fraction pool initially most sensitive to adoption of management practices that are liable to sequester carbon in the soil.	8	WOS:000235912800008	30	soil organic carbon; particle-size fractionation; organo-mineral complex; tillage and rotation system	GREAT-PLAINS; MATTER; NITROGEN; CULTIVATION; SEQUESTRATION; FERTILIZATION; MANAGEMENT; TURNOVER; POSITION; QUALITY	Wu, TY; Schoenau, JJ; Li, FM; Qian, PY; Malhi, SS; Shi, YC	2006	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

This phyto reactor integrates with other engineered systems to cover landfills, treat petrochemical spills in soils. intercept a soluble subsurface plume, and capture non-point surface sediment entrained in urban or field runoff.; There are many potential economic opportunities for biomass associated with phytoremediation. including bioenergy and traditional industrial products such as solid wood products and reconstituted products (i.e., paper, chip board, laminated beams, extruded trim).; More intangibly, phyto creates environmental benefits such as soil erosion control, carbon sequestration. and wildlife habitat. Phyto also creates socio-economic benefits by diversify regional manufacturing into new products that employs local labor, thus building value-added industry. Alternative crops develop a greater diversity of products from the farmland, making the regional economy less exposed to global commodity crop price fluctuations.; Thus, a strategic phyto treatment of non-point agricultural runoff would help diversify land use from annually tilled crops (corn, soybeans, wheat) into perennial, untilled tree crops. A landscape rebuilt using phyto would create diversity represented in business potential, healthier air and water, wildlife habitat. and aesthetics.; Moreover, phyto provides local and current pollutant treatment.

Yield, water use, and protein content of spring wheat grown after six years of alfalfa, crested wheatgrass, or spring wheat in semiarid southwestern Saskatchewan. Can. J. Plant Sci. 90: 489-497. In the semiarid prairie of western Canada, there is renewed interest for including short durations (<= 3 yr) of perennial forage in rotations with annual crops. However, there are producers who want to grow longer durations (>= 4 yr) of perennial forages in rotational systems. Therefore, we assessed spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield, grain protein, and water use efficiency following 6 yr of either crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.], or Walla (Medicago saliva L.), or wheat, and then 1 yr of fallow. Yield, water use, and water use efficiency were significantly lower in the first year of spring wheat production (2000) when the prior crop was crested wheatgrass or alfalfa than when it was wheat. In the second year (2001), which was a near record drought year, wheat yield and water use were significantly lower when the prior crop was alfalfa than when it was grass or wheat. From 2002 to 2005, there were no consistent differences in water use, water use efficiency, or yield of wheat due to the prior perennial crop. Wheat grain protein concentration was significantly higher following alfalfa compared with following crested wheatgrass or continuous spring wheat from 2000 to 2005. This effect was attributed to the higher N-supplying power of the soil following alfalfa. Soil water content below the rooting depth of most annual crops (>= 120 cm depth) was reduced by the prior alfalfa crop, and there was no evidence from 2000 to 2005 that soil water recharge was occurring below the 150 cm depth.	2	WOS:000281025800011	27	Semiarid prairie; alfalfa; grass; spring wheat; yield; protein; water use	NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; USE EFFICIENCY; CANADIAN PRAIRIES; SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN; STUBBLE; MICROCLIMATE; CHERNOZEM; CLIMATE	Cutforth, H.

This is based on the assumption that the rumen flora degrade and inactivate mycotoxins, thus protecting the animal. A number of mycotoxins, however, resist rumen degradation, causing distinct clinical signs of intoxication. Moreover, due to their complex diet, dairy cows may be exposed to a varying number of mycotoxins, originating from different feed materials such as roughage and concentrates. Exposure to these complex mixtures of mycotoxins may result in unexpected health risks. Due to a pre-existing negative energy balance, cows in the transition period are considered to be particularly sensitive to the exposure to feeds contaminated with moulds, fungal spores and mycotoxins.

The objectives of this work were to (i) determine whether tiller emergence under low phosphorus availability is a function of the availability of assimilates for growth or a direct result of low P availability, (ii) attempt to establish a quantitative relation between an index of the availability of P in the plant and the effects of P deficiency on tiller emergence, and (iii) to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in tiller emergence in field-grown wheat. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. INTA Oasis), was grown in the field under drip irrigation on a typic Argiudol, low in P (5.5 mu g P g(-1) soil Bray & Kurtz I) in Balcarce, Argentina. Treatments consisted of the combination of three levels of P fertilization 0, 60 and 200 kg P2O5 ha(-1), and two levels of assimilate availability, a control (non-shaded) and 65% of reduction in incident irradiance from seedling emergence until the end of tillering (shaded). Phosphorus treatments significantly modified the pattern of growth and development of the plants. Shading reduced the growth and concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates in leaves and stems. Leaf photosynthetic rate at saturating irradiance was reduced by P deficiency, but was not affected by shading. At shoot P concentrations less than 4.2 g P kg(-1) the heterogeneity in the plant population increased with respect to the number of plants bearing a certain tiller. At a shoot P concentration of 1.7 g P kg(-1) tillering ceased completely. Phosphorus deficiency directly altered the normal pattern of tiller emergence by slowing the emergence of leaves on the main stem (i.e. increasing the phyllochron), and by reducing the maximum rate of tiller emergence for each tiller.	20	WOS:000081309200015	43	leaf emergence; phosphorus; photosynthesis; tillering; wheat	LEAF EMERGENCE; SPRING WHEAT; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; WINTER-WHEAT; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS; MINERAL-NUTRITION; GRAIN DEVELOPMENT; PLANTS; GROWTH; BARLEY	Rodriguez, D; Andrade, FH; Goudriaan, J	1999	TS=(perennial NEAR/1 wheat)	NONE

The relative susceptibility of 17 commercial cultivars of three bentgrass species (creeping, colonial and velvet bentgrass) to Microdochium nivale and the aggressiveness of M. nivale eight isolates obtained from infected turfgrasses on golf courses in Wisconsin were evaluated under controlled conditions. For the field trial, susceptibility of 2 year-old 12 commercial bentgrass cultivars was evaluated after inoculating three M. nivale isolates in the fields. There were significant differences in disease severities among the three bentgrass species, particularly between tetraploids (creeping and colonial) and diploid (velvet) species, and among cultivars within each species, indicating that there are varying levels of susceptibility in species and cultivars to M. nivale. Host resistance by days of cold hardening was confirmed, by detecting the resistance by 30 days of cold hardening treatments. In field trial, susceptibility of 12 bentgrass cultivars was highly correlated to the results obtained from growth chamber experiments. The positive correlation of the susceptibility between growth chamber experiments and field trials demonstrates that the growth chamber method is a useful technique for saving time, space and labor to evaluate efficiently pink snow mold susceptibility of bentgrass cultivars. This study could be applied to evaluating susceptibility of bentgrass to pink snow mold and also predicting a prospective evaluation of bentgrass cultivars to pink snow mold in fields in a breeding program.	0	WOS:000294511500004	31	bentgrass; hardening; host resistant; Microdochium nivale; mycelium suspension	CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS; SNOW MOLD; LOW-TEMPERATURE; WINTER-WHEAT; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS; FUSARIUM-NIVALE; RESISTANCE; INFECTION; GRASSES; SPP.

Millsp.] genotypes in 1989/90, 1990/91 and 1991/92 at the ICRISAT Asia Center, Andhra Pradesh, India. Traits with which this variation could be associated were assessed. Differences in the total ratoon yield of two flushes were significant among the genotypes in each season. In a few genotypes, ratoon yield constituted 50 % of the total yield, which could be as high as 5.6 t/ha. Total ratoon yield was positively correlated with leaf area index in the last 2 years of experimentation. The relationship of total ratoon yield to main crop yield was significantly positive in 1991/92 only. The results suggest that there is a large variation in ratoonability among short-duration genotypes and that high leaf area retention at main crop maturity appears to contribute substantially to this variation.	2	WOS:A1996VU56600008	12	NONE	CAJANUS-CAJAN	Chauhan, YS; Johansen, C; Gupta, SC	1996	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 pigeonpea)	NONE

Accessions (297) of pigeonpea landraces were collected from major production areas in four countries in the region and evaluated for desirable agronomic traits, particularly resistance to fusarium wilt and market-preferred traits. Selected germplasm was utilized in the regional breeding program aimed at genetic enhancement of pigeonpea. Five improved long-duration (LD) cultivars that are highly resistant to fusarium wilt and have large (100-grain weight >15.0 g) grains were developed. Similarly, six early maturing medium-duration (MD) cultivars (averaging 2.5 t/ha) for production in the high latitude areas in the region and three MD cultivars that are able to ratoon, were developed. Seed of pre-released cultivars that are preferred by the farmers was distributed widely in the region in order to facilitate adoption. Consequently, the productivity of pigeonpea and food security in the region improved significantly.	2	WOS:000266192600149	13	Germplasm; landrace; pigeonpea; ratoon	FUSARIUM-WILT; MILLSP.; REGISTRATION; RESISTANCE	Gwata, E.

Taporuri produced the hi,,hest total dry matter yield, with a value 60% higher than that of Hinohikari. The first crop of Taporuri had a longer duration of vegetative growth than those of Mohretsu and Hinohikari, and had the highest dry matter yield because of its greater weight per tiller than Hinohikari and its more tillers per square meter than Saikaishi 253, which had a similar duration of vegetative growth. The second crops of Mohretsu, Taporuri, and Saikaishi 253 had longer vegetative growth and higher dry matter yields than Hinohikari. Dry matter yields of both crops were closely related to the duration of vegetative growth and the weight per tiller, but not to tillers per square meter. These results suggest that cultivars with a long duration of vegetative growth, high weight per tiller, and adequate tillers per square meter can produce high dry matter yield in both crops. There was a significant interaction (P < 0.05) in total dry matter yield between cultivar or line and cultivation type. The total dry matter yield of Taporuri in twice harvesting was about 10% higher than that in once harvesting, whereas that of Hinohikari was about 10% lower. The suitability for twice harvesting ([total dry matter yield in twice harvesting]/[total dry matter yield in once harvesting]) was significantly positively correlated (r = 0.875) with the increase in dry weight before the full heading stage, but significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.903)with the increase in dry weight between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. Thus, cultivars with a high increase in dry weight before full heading appear to be more suitable for twice harvesting than those with a high increase between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. In addition, our study showed that twice harvesting can prevent lodging in Taporuri, thereby increasing the suitability of this cultivar as a forage rice. Our results suggest that twice harvesting can be performed in southwestern Japan and warmer regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of drainage and irrigation periods, before and after, respectively, main crop harvest on the performance of flooded rice main and ratoon crop. Treatments consisted of the combination of four drainage periods (0, 10, 20, and 30 days) before the main crop harvest with the introduction of irrigation at 0, 10, 20, and 30 days after the main crop harvest. The experimental design was a randomized complete block in a 4x4 factorial scheme, with four replication. The rice ratoon crop performance was differently affected by the irrigation periods after main crop harvest according to environmental conditions. Retardation in flooding decreased grain yield and grain quality, when air temperatures unsuitable to ratoon crop development occurred. Under suitable air temperatures conditions, starting flooding at nine days after the main crop harvest was the best treatment to the performance of ratoon crop, which represented 14% of saved irrigation water. Rice ratoon crop apparently is not favorable to the development of Oryzophagus oryzae harmful population.	2	WOS:000178900500009	20	Oryza sativa; irrigation; drainage; climatic factors; crop yield; grain quality	NONE	dos Santos, AB; Ferreira, E; Stone, LF; da Silva, SC; Ramos, CG	2002	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE

Anthers were plated onto N6 liquid media with 0, 2, 5, and 10 mg l(-1) ABA, respectively. After 5 days in culture, the media were removed and N6 medium without ABA was added. A higher number of pre-mitotic P-pollen grains were observed in anthers from ratooned plants. A significant synergistic effect was found between anthers from ratooned plants/ABA concentrations and the increase in embryogenic-like structures (ELS) induction and green plant regeneration efficiency. The highest frequency of anthers producing ELS was found in N6 medium (6% Sucrose and 2 mg l(-1) 2,4-D) with 5 and 10 mg l(-1) ABA for anthers derived from ratooned plants. Mean green plant regeneration efficiencies were raised from 24.2 to 42% (non-ratooned), and from 30 to 70%, (ratooned donor plants) using a combination of 10 mg l(-1) ABA in induction media, and MS with 2 mg l(-1) BAP, 1 mg l(-1) NAA, 2 mg l(-1) kinetin and 0.45% agarose. The highest number of green shoots per ELS were obtained from ratooned-derived anthers (up to 82).

Lowering the main-crop stubble height by harvesting the main crop at a lower than traditional height is believed to alter growth parameters and increase ratoon yields. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of main-crop stubble height on ratoon grain yield, agronomics, and cumulative/weekly panicle growth parameters (density, point of origin, and weight). Main-crop 'Cocodrie' and 'Trenasse' rice cultivars; were harvested to leave either a 40- or 20-cm stubble height. When the main-crop stubble was harvested at 20 cm, ratoon rice grain yield in 2007 was increased by 375 and 190 kg ha(-1) for Cocodrie and Trenasse, respectively. Yield was not improved in 2006 using the low (20 cm) harvest height. The yield advantage in 2007 was associated with the increased weight of the basal panicles when the main crop was harvested at 20 cm. When the main-crop stubble was 20 cm, basal and axial panicle points of origin were numerically similar 5 weeks after main-crop harvest (WAH), while panicles originating from basal nodes were predominant 6 WAH and beyond. In contrast, when the main-crop stubble was 40 cm, approximately 75% of the emerged panicles originated from axial nodes 5 WAH, panicles from both axial and basal points of origin were nearly identical 6 WAH, and basal panicles were dominant thereafter. Results from this study indicate that when the initial stubble height is reduced from 40 to 20 cm the growth of the ratoon crop is altered by shifting panicle point of origin during the early growth period and delaying maturity.

The total estimated whole-plant TDN yield (i.e., of the first crop plus second crop) of Taporuri was the highest in double harvesting. In the first crop, the estimated whole-plant TDN yield of Taporuri was the highest. In the second crop, the estimated whole-plant TDN yield of Taporuri was almost the same as those of Mohretsu and Tachiaoba but higher than that of Hinohikari. We also examined the effects of cultivation method (double harvesting or single harvesting) on estimated TDN yield of forage rice. In Taporuri and Mohretsu, the total estimated whole-plant TDN yield was similar in double harvesting and single harvesting. However, in Tachiaoba and Hinohikari, it was lower in double harvesting than in single harvesting. It is important to maximize the amount of nutrition in leaf and stem rather than panicle because the grain is not digested well by cattle. In the double harvesting, the total estimated leaf blade (leaf) TDN yield of Taporuri was higher than that of Hinohikari and almost the same as those of Tachiaoba and Mohretsu. The total estimated leaf sheath plus stem (stem) TDN yield of Taporuri was the highest. in comparison of the total TDN yield of double harvesting with that of single harvesting, the total estimated leaf and stem TDN yields were higher in double harvesting than in single harvesting in all cultivars except for Hinohikari. Thus, double harvesting of Taporuri is an effective way of reducing the overall loss of nutrition from the crop. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Khorasgan Branch, Esfahan, Iran	NONE	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT	Effects of harvesting time and harvesting height on grain yield and agronomical characters in rice ratoon (Oryza sativa L.)	NONE	Rice is the staple food and it is the second most important food in Iran. In order to survey the effects of harvest time and harvest height on grain yield and yield components of rice (Taroem Hasemi variety), an experiment was done in Sari province in 2009. A split plot design within randomized complete block design with 3 replications was used. In this experiment, harvest time was considered as the main factor at two levels (T1 the first harvest on 29(th) August and T2 8(th) September), and harvest height was considered as sub factor (H1 level ground, H2 10 cm, H3 20 cm, H4 30 cm and H5 40 cm). Harvest time had significant effect on grain yield and harvest index. Plant height, flag leaf length, panicle length, straw yield and biological yield were not significantly affected by harvest time. Harvest time and interaction of harvest time and harvesting height had no significant influence on experimental characteristics. On the basis of the results the highest plant height, flag lead length, panicle length, grain yield, straw yield, biological yield and harvest index were obtained on 29(th) August harvesting time. There were no significant differences between harvesting height treatment, but the highest yield was related to harvesting height of 40 cm. The low grain yield of the rice may be attributed to the poor management of cutting height and harvesting time during the cultivation and harvesting period. The results of the survey concluded that the harvesting at 40 cm height on 29(th) August had the potential to produce higher yields.	0	WOS:000300924100089	18	Harvesting time; harvest height; grain yield; agronomical characters; rice	CUTTING HEIGHT; COMPONENTS; HERBICIDES	Yazdpour, Hossein; Shahri, Mohamad Mehdi; Soleymani, Ali; Shahrajabian, Mohamad Hesam	2012	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE

In this study, an attempt was made to correlate the carbohydrate concentration in stubbles of main crop at harvest, as influenced by fertilizer-management practices, with ratoon yield. The different fertilizer treatments influenced the sugar and starch content in stubbles significantly during both the years. On an average, the sugar (3.7%) and starch (8.25%) content was maximum in recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) + sunnhemp treatment. Similarly, the grain yield of main as well as ratoon crops was also maximum with RDF + sunnhemp treatment (7,142 and 2,123 kg/ha). The correlation coefficients between grain yield of ratoon crop and sugar and starch content in stubbles of main crop were also significant and positive.	1	WOS:000188766300013	6	organic manures; stem carbohydrate and starch; ratoon crop yield	NONE	Manjappa, K; Prabhakar, AS	2003	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE

In this study, we performed a QTL analysis for yield and yield-component traits of an F-2 population based on data from replicated field trials over 2 years using vegetative shoots of ratooned plants, making use of the ratooning habit of rice. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of conducting QTL analyses directly based on an F-2 population by means of ratooning plants. The experimental population was from a cross between 'Zhenshan 97' and 'Minghui 63', the parents of 'Shanyou 63', an elite rice hybrid widely grown in China. Agenetic linkage map containing 151 molecular markers was constructed for QTL I napping. A total of 20 distinct QTLs were detected. eight of these were detected in both years and remaining 12 in only 1 year. Compared with the results of our previous analysis of the F-2:3 families from the same cross, it was shown that most of the QTLs detected in the ratooned F-2 population were also detected in the F-2:3 population. However, the estimates of both additive and dominant types of genetic effects for many of the QTLs based on F-2 ratoons were substantially larger than those based on F-2:3 families. The results indicate that vegetatively ratooned F-2 populations may have considerable utility in the mapping of QTLs, especially if dominant types of gene actions are of concern, although there were certain technical limitations in making use of such populations in the experiments.	38	WOS:000088403800036	20	Oryza sativa L.; ratoon; molecular marker; QTL	DOUBLED-HAPLOID POPULATION; MOLECULAR MAP; ORYZA-SATIVA; POLYMORPHISM; MARKERS; MAIZE	Li, JX; Yu, SB; Xu, CG; Tan, YF; Gao, YJ; Li, XH; Zhang, Q	2000	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE

In all, 5 organic nutrition modules involving combinations of organic amendments (sulphitation pressmud and farmyard manure), legume intercrop lentil (Lens culinaris L.) and endophytic/associative diazotrophs (Gluconacetobactor diazotrophicus and Azotobactor chroococum) were tested against control (no manure or fertilizer). Results revealed that supply of nutrients to sugarcane through combined use of sulphitation pressmud 10 tonnes/ha + farmyard manure 10 tonnes/ha gave the highest cane yield (84.6 and 74.2 tonnes/ha for plant and ratoon cane). The treatment also effected significant improvement in soil health at the end of rotation as indicated by 35.2% increase in organic carbon, 158.4% increase in microbial biomass carbon and 118.9% enhancement in soil microbial biomass nitrogen. Besides, the organic nutrition modules resulted in significant increase in the contribution of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon varying from 5.95 to 6.97% against 3.11% of initial value. Soil physical properties were also enhanced as bulk density reduced from 1.34 Mg/m(3) to 1.25 Mg/m(3) or less, water stable aggregates swelled from 0.349 mm diameter to 0.387 mm or more under organic nutrition modules at ratoon harvest. However, farmyard manure 20 tonnes/ha + Trichoderma viride + lentil intercropping (1: 2) proved most profitable (B: C ratio 2.7) for planted crop and sulphitation pressmud 10 tonnes/ha + farmyard manure 10 tonnes/ha for ratoon crop (B: C ratio 3.0).	1	WOS:000265901300004	10	Economics; Organic nutrition; Physical properties; Soil microbial activity; Sugarcane productivity	NONE	Srivastava, T.

The ratoon screening method, showed variability in rice varieties potential for growth inhibition of barnyardgrass. Rice varieties showing high growth inhibition of barnyardgrass were taller, had higher tillers and produced more biomass than did the low inhibition varieties. The rice straw meal and soil Mixture cultivation method also showed the maximum coefficient of variation in barnyardgrass root length. The growth parameters (early vigour, plant height, tillers number) of 39 rice varieties from 2 groups (Japonica and Indica varieties) were compared for suppression effect on root length of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli var. oryzicola.).

The highest total dry matter yield was 27.1 t ha(-1). We examined the effects of two times of first harvest (booting stage versus full heading stage). Plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 50% higher dry matter yield of first crop than those harvested at the booting stage, because the plants had greater weights per tiller than those harvested at the booting stage. Plants harvested at the booting stage produced 37% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those harvested at the full heading stage, because the plants had greater dry weights per tiller than those harvested at the full heading stage. Overall, plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 8% higher total dry matter yield than those harvested at the booting stage. We also examined the effects of two total amounts of nitrogen (300 kg N ha(-1) versus 150 kg N ha(-1)) and three nitrogen application methods (method 1: 33.3% applied at transplanting, 66.7% at the maximum tiller number stage, 0.0% at 7 days after the first harvest, and 0.0% at 21 days after the first harvest; method 2: 33.3, 33.3, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively; method 3: 33.3, 0.0, 33.3%, and 33.3%, respectively). For the first crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha(-1) produced 10% higher dry matter yield than those that received 150 kg N ha(-1) in 2004. Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 produced 21% and 23% higher dry matter yield of first crop than plants that underwent method 3, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha(-1) treatment and in nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of first crop in these treatments. For the second crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha(-1) produced 10% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those that received 150 kg N ha(-1). Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 produced 57% and 56% higher dry matter yield of second crop than method 1, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha(-1) treatment and in nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of second crop in these treatments. Overall, plants that received 300 kg N ha(-1) produced 7% higher dry matter yield than those that received 150 kg N ha(-1) and plants that underwent nitrogen application method 2 produced 21% and 11% higher dry matter yield than those that underwent methods 1 and 3, respectively. Therefore, our findings suggest that to produce the highest total dry matter yield the best time for first harvest is the full heading stage and the best nitrogen management is to provide 300 kg N ha(-1) in accordance with nitrogen application method 2.

The experimental design was a split-split plot with randomized complete block design with three replications. Accordingly, three levels of N (0, 35 and 70 kg ha(-1)) in main plots, two planting dates of berseem clover (coincident with main crop harvest and 40 days after it) in sub plots and two harvesting heights (10 and 40 cm above the soil surface) in sub-sub plots were laid out. The application of 70 kg N ha(-1) and short harvest height (10 cm) yielded the highest ratoon rice grain, ratoon days to 50% heading and harvest index. The best biological yield was obtained from higher harvest height as well. Qualitative traits such as gelatinization temperature (GT) and protein content (PC) increased with large amount of N. But amylose content (AC) and gel consistency (GC) were not affected by experimental treatments. Effect of nitrogen and harvest height on fresh and dry weight of both cuts, protein content in the first cutting and total land equivalent ratio (LER) were significant at 1% level. The highest fresh and dry weight yield was obtained by application of 35 kg N ha(-1). The highest protein and total LER obtained from higher N application (70 kg N ha(-1)). All studied traits had the highest value in shorter harvest height and the first planting date of berseem clover.	2	WOS:000292570600010	61	Nitrogen; Harvest height; Intercropping; Berseem clover; Ratoon rice	FORAGE YIELD; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; CUTTING HEIGHT; TROPICAL RICE; DRY-MATTER; HAY YIELD; BARLEY; MIXTURES; QUALITY; GROWTH	Petroudi, Elyas Rahimi; Noormohammadi, Ghorban; Mirhadi, Mohammad Javad; Madani, Hamid; Mobasser, Hamid Reza	2011	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE	
UNIV FLORIDA,EVERGLADES RES & EDUC CTR,BELLE GLADE,FL 33430	NONE	AGRONOMY JOURNAL	REFLOOD TIMING FOR RATOON RICE GROWN ON EVERGLADES HISTOSOLS	NONE	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) ratooning is commonly practiced in the Everglades Agricultural Area of southern Florida, yet optimum length of the drained period between main and ratoon crops has not been determined. Research was conducted to determine the effect of length of drain period at main-crop harvest on ratoon rice productivity on an Everglades Histosol. Our research was conducted in 250-L (0.95 m height, 0.58 m i.d.) custom-made water control lysimeters filled with a Pahokee muck soil (euic, hyperthermic Lithic Medisaprist). Ratoon reflood timing treatments were 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 d drained beginning at main-crop maturity. Ratoon-crop grain yield exhibited a significant quadratic response to length of drain period with maximum grain yield produced at 28 d drained. Ratoon panicle number was not affected by reflood timing, but quadratic responses to length of drain period were observed for grain number and 1000-grain weight. We propose that the resultant effect of reflood timing on ratoon grain yield was the combined responses to increasing mineral N supply and increasing water stress associated with delayed reflooding. For drained durations <28 d, the beneficial effects of increased mineral N supply resulting from organic matter oxidation resulted in a net increase in ratoon-crop yield. Conversely, for drained periods >28 d, the detrimental impact of prolonged water stress dominated the response to reflood timing and ratoon rice yields declined.	3	WOS:A1994NU49400003	21	NONE	NONE	COALE, FJ; JONES, DB	1994	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE

Sampling in three outbreak areas during 1994 showed that the insect's annual cycle varied according to the agroecological zone and rice cropping pattern. In the humid forest zone, Orseolia oryzivora persisted through the short dry season on ratoons of cultivated rice Oryza sativa at a rainfed site and on dry season rice crops at an irrigated one. In contrast, at rainfed sites in the moist savannah zone the pest survived the longer dry season on the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata, while ratoons and volunteers of O. sativa provided 'bridges' between the wild host and wet season rice crops. Early in the wet season at rainfed sites, galls of Orseolia oryzivora were not found at high density on wild rice, ratoons or volunteers. The heavy infestations which developed by October resulted primarily from rapid multiplication on rice crops themselves during the wet season. At all 13 sites sampled, the large majority of galls were found on fallow or cropped rice fields, rather than in ditches, bunds or uncultivated wetland, irrespective of the time of year or the hosts involved. From gall dissections, the parasitoids Aprostocetus procerae (Risbec) and Platygaster diplosisae Risbec caused over 30% mortality at some sites by October but generally increased too late to prevent crop damage. Implications of the results for the management of Orseolia oryzivora are discussed.	5	WOS:000086387600012	20	NONE	BURKINA-FASO; HARRIS; GAGNE	Williams, CT; Okhidievbie, O; Harris, KM; Ukwungwu, MN	1999	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE	
NONE	NONE	CROP SCIENCE	RICE RATOON CROP YIELD LINKED TO MAIN CROP STEM CARBOHYDRATES	NONE	Ratooning of rice (Oryza sativa L.) may be agronomically possible in climates where the crop season is to short too produce two rice crops, but factors influencing ratoon rice yields are not well understood. The influence of main crop total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) and main crop N topdressing on ratoon crop yield of four contrasting field-grown rice cultivars were evaluated in Texas during 1988 and 1989. Allowing panicles to develop normally or removing the upper two-thirds of each main crop panicle 10 d after initial main crop heading created a range in TNC of the culm and leaves during later stages of main crop development for determining TNC effects on ratooning. Nitrogen applied 10 d after initial main crop heading corrected any possible N deficiency, but did not increase main crop yield, TNC, or ratoon crop yield, indicating no benefits to N applied immediately after main crop heading. During main crop grain filling, culm and leaf TNC levels of plants with normal panicles decreased to low levels (0-90 g kg-1), then gradually increased and ranged from 40 to 170 g kg-1 at harvest. In contrast, TNC in culms and leaves of plants with incomplete panicles gradually increased during main crop grain filling reaching 140 to 310 g kg-1 at main crop harvest. Main crop plants with elevated TNC levels produced ratoon yields up to 5.3 Mg ha-1, averaging 48 and 33% higher than plants with low TNC at main crop harvest in 1988 and 1989, respectively. These data illustrate a moderate positive correlation (R2 = 0.66) between ratoon yields and TNC in culm and leaves at main crop harvest for effects due to years, panicle removal, and cultivars.	12	WOS:A1993KT47500027	16	NONE	NONE	TURNER, FT; JUND, MF	1993	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 oryza)	NONE

We have identified genes expressed at substantially higher levels in rhizomes than other plant parts, and explored their functional categorization, genomic organization, regulatory motifs, and association with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring rhizomatousness. The finding that genes with rhizome-enriched expression are distributed across a wide range of functional categories suggests some degree of specialization of individual members of many gene families in rhizomatous plants. A disproportionate share of genes with rhizome-enriched expression was implicated in secondary and hormone metabolism, and abiotic stimuli and development. A high frequency of unknown-function genes reflects our still limited knowledge of this plant organ. A putative oligosaccharyl transferase showed the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression, with several transcriptional or regulatory protein complex factors also showing high ( but lesser) degrees of specificity. Inferred by the upstream sequences of their putative rice ( Oryza sativa) homologs, sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor) genes that were relatively highly expressed in rhizome tip tissues were enriched for cis-element motifs, including the pyrimidine box, TATCCA box, and CAREs box, implicating the gibberellins in regulation of many rhizome-specific genes. From cDNA clones showing rhizome-enriched expression, expressed sequence tags forming 455 contigs were plotted on the rice genome and aligned to QTL likelihood intervals for ratooning and rhizomatous traits in rice and sorghum. Highly expressed rhizome genes were somewhat enriched in QTL likelihood intervals for rhizomatousness or ratooning, with specific candidates including some of the most rhizome-specific genes. Some rhizomatousness and ratooning QTLs were shown to be potentially related to one another as a result of ancient duplication, suggesting long-term functional conservation of the underlying genes. Insight into genes and pathways that influence rhizome growth set the stage for genetic and/or exogenous manipulation of rhizomatousness, and for further dissection of the molecular evolution of rhizomatousness.	22	WOS:000241892900030	54	NONE	HALEPENSE L PERS; MADS-BOX GENES; MONOSACCHARIDE TRANSPORTERS; SEQUENCE TAGS; PLANT-GROWTH; ARABIDOPSIS; RICE; PROTEIN; EVOLUTION; PROMOTER	Jang, Cheol Seong; Kamps, Terry L.; Skinner, D.

VCG 01213, so-called 'tropical race 4', is just one of six distinct strains that can attack Cavendish, but it is much more aggressive on Cavendish than strains known earlier in Australia and South Africa. New plantations established in the 1990s in peninsula Malaysia and Sumatra soon succumbed. VCG 01213 was later found to be common in village banana plants in those areas. It is only one of eight strains present in the villages. It is not a new mutant strain but is only newly recognised as unique. The combination of many strains and many different cultivars in mixed plantings allows sufficient banana production for home use. Yet attempts to grow Cavendish in plantation fail within a few years of establishment. Commercial Cavendish production in Taiwan, where strain VCG 01213 is present, is possible only by planting partially resistant Cavendish mutants in rotation with paddy rice and ratooning only twice. Even so, losses continue and costs are high. Permanent commercial plantations are no longer economic in areas where VCG 01213 is found. However, surveys indicate this pathogen is not ubiquitous. VCG 01213 was recently introduced into the Northern Territory of Australia, where eradication was attempted. This involved investigation of source, elimination of entire banana fields, isolation of sites, no replanting and tight quarantine. The situation here is not confounded by 'village banana plants' and is simplified by isolation and distance from the country's main banana-growing areas. In the Philippines and China, the disease now occurs in plantations situated within large areas of commercial banana production. The threat was at first not taken seriously and strain identification was delayed. Spread has occurred very rapidly in South China and less so in the Philippines. The VCG 01213 pathosystem is virtually unstudied, and its biology and epidemiology unknown. The results of experimental studies in Sumatra on incidence, treatment with endophytes and antagonists, cassava rotation, timing of infection, root invasion and breeding for resistance are reported. Rotation with cassava appears promising.	7	WOS:000305709600019	15	dissemination; endophytes; Fusarium wilt; incidence; inoculum potential; origin; systemicity; cassava	WILT; PLANTS	Buddenhagen, I.	2009	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Oryza sativa L, as affected by main crop harvest cutting height and the production of a ratoon crop. Substantial infestations (>5.6 stem borers/m(2)) remained in rice culms regardless of cutting height (20 vs. 40 cm). However, the 20-cm cutting height reduced E. loftini infestations by 70 -81% whereas D. saccharalis infestations were not affected. Plant dissections showed that compared to D. saccharalis larvae and pupae, relatively more E. loftini immatures are located high in rice plants (>20 cm from the base of the culm). In October, the ratoon crop was more infested with stem borers than the unmanaged main crop stubble during the first year of the study. The opposite was observed during the second year. Differences in unmanaged main crop stubble phenology between the two years likely caused these differences in infestation levels. During the post-growing season, infestations in main and ratoon crop stubble decreased over the winter. After favorable winter conditions, infestations in main and ratoon crop stubble did not differ, attaining 3.3 E. loftini/m(2) and 0.4 D. saccharalis/m(2) by March 2008. In March 2009, rice stubble harbored 0.3 E. loftini/m(2) and 0.2 D. saccharalis/m(2) regardless of whether only a main crop or a main and ratoon crop had been produced. This study showed that a lower rice harvest cutting height can suppress late season E. loftini populations. Furthermore, rice stubble under favorable conditions represents a substantial overwintering habitat, thus warranting evaluation of pest management tactics targeting overwintering populations.

Because existing research on winter food abundance and depletion is insufficient to test this hypothesis, we used harvested rice fields as model foraging habitats to determine if waste rice seed is depleted before spring migration. We sampled rice fields (n = 39 [winter 2000-2001], n = 69 [2001-2002]) to estimate seed mass when waterfowl arrived in late autumn and departed in late winter. We also placed exclosures in subsets of fields in autumn (n = 8 [2000-2001], n = 20 [2001-2002]) and compared seed mass inside and outside exclosures in late winter to estimate rice depletion attributable to waterfowl and other processes. Finally, we used an experiment to determine if the extent of rice depletion differed among fields of varying initial abundance and if the seed mass at which waterfowl ceased foraging or abandoned fields differed from a hypothesized giving-up value of 50 kg/ha. Mean seed mass was greater in late autumn 2000 than 2001 (127.0 vs. 83.9 kg/ha; P = 0.018) but decreased more during winter 2000-2001 than 2001-2002 (91.3 vs. 55.7 kg/ha) and did not differ at the end of winter (35.8 vs. 28.3 kg/ha; P = 0.651). Assuming equal loss to deterioration inside and outside exclosures, we estimated waterfowl consumed 61.3 kg/ha (48.3%) of rice present in late autumn 2000 and 21.1 kg/ha (25.1%) in 2001. When we manipulated late-autumn rice abundance, mean giving-up mass of rice seed was similar among treatments (48.7 kg/ha; P = 0.205) and did not differ from 50 kg/ha (P = 0.726). We integrated results by constructing scenarios in which waterfowl consumed rice at different times in winter, consumption and deterioration were competing risks, and consumption occurred only above 50 kg/ha. Results indicated waterfowl likely consumed available rice soon after fields were flooded and the amount consumed exceeded our empirical estimates but was <= 48% (winters pooled) of rice initially present. We suggest 1) using 50 kg/ha as a threshold below which profitability limits waterfowl feeding in MAV rice fields; 2) reducing the current estimate (130 kg/ha) of rice consumed in harvested fields to 47.2 kg/ha; and 3) increasing available rice by increasing total area of fields managed, altering management practices (e. g., staggered flooding), and exploring the potential for producing second or ratoon rice crops for waterfowl.

IN A SOUTHERN GUINEA SAVANNAH OF NIGERIA	NONE	Sustainability in crop production could be achieved using agricultural wastes which litter the environment to ameliorate crop soils. The effect of organic mulches on the growth and yield of two sugar cane varieties (NCS 008 and Bida local) was therefore evaluated during 2010 (plant crop) and 2011 (ratoon crop) at Badeggi (9(0) 03'N, 06(0) 09'E; altitude 89 m a.s.l.) Nigeria. Mulch materials (rice husk and groundnut shell) were each applied at the rates of 0, 20 and 40 tonnes ha(-1) in a factorial experiment laid out in a randomised complete block design (RCBD), with three replications. The variety NCS 008 produced significantly (p<0.05) higher number of tillers, stalk length, yield and chewable stalks in both the regular and ratoon crops relative to the local. The establishment count of NCS 008 was higher compared to Bida local (73% vs. 38%) in the ratoon and vice versa in the plant crop. Mulching with groundnut shell produced significantly (p<0.05) higher establishment count and stalk lengths compared to rice husk mulch for the ratoon crops, but did not differ appreciably in the main (plant) crop. Irrespective of the cropping system, stalk girth, tiller count, chewable stalks and yield were significantly (p < 0.05) higher with groundnut shell compared with rice husk mulch. Aside from establishment count, which had an inverse relationship with mulching rate in the plant crop, all the other traits assessed had a direct relationship with mulching rate in the two systems.

It was evident that the ratooning ability was influenced by stem thickness of stubble, carbohydrate content and leaf senescence of main crop. The study also suggests that by maintaining higher seed size and productive tiller in ratoon crop, there is ample possibilities to increase grain yield.	1	WOS:A1992HG18400002	10	MAIN CROP; RATOON CROP; LEAF SENESCENCE; STEM THICKNESS; STUBBLE CARBOHYDRATE CONTENT	NONE	BALASUBRAMANIAN, R; BALAKRISHNAN, K; MANOHARAN, S	1992	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Taporuri produced the hi,,hest total dry matter yield, with a value 60% higher than that of Hinohikari. The first crop of Taporuri had a longer duration of vegetative growth than those of Mohretsu and Hinohikari, and had the highest dry matter yield because of its greater weight per tiller than Hinohikari and its more tillers per square meter than Saikaishi 253, which had a similar duration of vegetative growth. The second crops of Mohretsu, Taporuri, and Saikaishi 253 had longer vegetative growth and higher dry matter yields than Hinohikari. Dry matter yields of both crops were closely related to the duration of vegetative growth and the weight per tiller, but not to tillers per square meter. These results suggest that cultivars with a long duration of vegetative growth, high weight per tiller, and adequate tillers per square meter can produce high dry matter yield in both crops. There was a significant interaction (P < 0.05) in total dry matter yield between cultivar or line and cultivation type. The total dry matter yield of Taporuri in twice harvesting was about 10% higher than that in once harvesting, whereas that of Hinohikari was about 10% lower. The suitability for twice harvesting ([total dry matter yield in twice harvesting]/[total dry matter yield in once harvesting]) was significantly positively correlated (r = 0.875) with the increase in dry weight before the full heading stage, but significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.903)with the increase in dry weight between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. Thus, cultivars with a high increase in dry weight before full heading appear to be more suitable for twice harvesting than those with a high increase between full heading and the yellow ripe stage. In addition, our study showed that twice harvesting can prevent lodging in Taporuri, thereby increasing the suitability of this cultivar as a forage rice. Our results suggest that twice harvesting can be performed in southwestern Japan and warmer regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Based on land and water management, rice ecosystem is mainly divided into lowland, upland and deep water or floating rice. Rice ratooning is mainly practiced on lowland rice ecosystem. Ratooning provides higher resource use efficiency per unit time and per unit land area. However, better yield of ratoon crop is possible by adopting appropriate management practices for main crop as well as for ratoon crop. These management practices include land preparation, adequate plant density and spacing, use of appropriate cultivars, water management, application of adequate rate of fertilizers, appropriate height of cutting, and control of diseases, insects and weeds.	9	WOS:000182438900020	149	NONE	NITROGEN-USE EFFICIENCY; SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; LOWLAND RICE; IRRIGATED RICE; CULTIVAR DIFFERENCES; SAVANNA REGIONS; SEEDING RATE; GRAIN-YIELD; UPLAND RICE; MAIN CROP	Santos, AB; Fageria, NK; Prabhu, AS	2003	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of drainage and irrigation periods, before and after, respectively, main crop harvest on the performance of flooded rice main and ratoon crop. Treatments consisted of the combination of four drainage periods (0, 10, 20, and 30 days) before the main crop harvest with the introduction of irrigation at 0, 10, 20, and 30 days after the main crop harvest. The experimental design was a randomized complete block in a 4x4 factorial scheme, with four replication. The rice ratoon crop performance was differently affected by the irrigation periods after main crop harvest according to environmental conditions. Retardation in flooding decreased grain yield and grain quality, when air temperatures unsuitable to ratoon crop development occurred. Under suitable air temperatures conditions, starting flooding at nine days after the main crop harvest was the best treatment to the performance of ratoon crop, which represented 14% of saved irrigation water. Rice ratoon crop apparently is not favorable to the development of Oryzophagus oryzae harmful population.	2	WOS:000178900500009	20	Oryza sativa; irrigation; drainage; climatic factors; crop yield; grain quality	NONE	dos Santos, AB; Ferreira, E; Stone, LF; da Silva, SC; Ramos, CG	2002	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

In total, six treatments (three replicates) were investigated: four different polyculture combinations of small sized silver barb, Puntius gonionotus (Bleeker, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), and common carp, Cyprinus carpio L.; one treatment with pre-grown fingerlings; and a control treatment in which no fish were stocked. No insecticides or fungicides were utilized before or during the experiment. Frequent fertilization of the water and a low rice plant biomass during the early vegetative growth phase stimulated the development of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The total weed biomass was low (maximum = 5.3 g dry weight m(-2)) and not significantly (P < 0.05) different between the treatments, A major component of the silver barb diet consisted of rice plants and accessible grains. However, the introduction of silver barb only had a significant effect on the number of rice tillers in the ratoon crop and not on the paddy yield. The quantitative differences in the diets of tilapia and common carp were minimal: both species fed mostly on detritus. Ricefields without silver barb produced the highest paddy yield (3120 kg ha(-1)). The total yield of introduced fish increased after increasing the stocking density of silver barb from 319.9 to 494.1 kg ha(-1). The highest fish yield (541.8 kg ha(-1)) was obtained by stocking pre-grown fingerlings in the ricefields.	19	WOS:000076933800005	34	NONE	FISH CULTURE; NORTHEAST THAILAND; FIELDS	Rothuis, AJ; Duong, LT; Richter, CJJ; Ollevier, F	1998	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Nitrogen balance in a paddy-field water-purifying system in which cattle feces were applied was studied for 4 years to assess the suitability of the system for a subtropical area, Japan. Three successive harvestings using ratoon of forage rice following one rice transplanting were conducted with chemical fertilizer and high and low rates of cattle-feces application. Nitrogen load was 81.3-495.0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), while nitrogen uptake was highly dependent on the yield of the first harvesting. Annual variation of forage rice yields was large, ranging from 15.5 to 26.8 Mg ha(-1) owing to fluctuation in the yield at second and later harvestings. On average, nitrogen was lost by leaching at a rate of 2.3-3.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The nitrogen content in soil at a depth of 0-5 cm increased up to 12.2 kg N ha(-1) over the 4-year period compared with that before the field experiment. However, continuous application of cattle feces could slightly increase the nitrogen content in soil at a depth greater than 35 cm. Our results showed the ability of flooded forage rice to remove nitrogen at up to 320.1 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for a field to which cattle feces were applied. Further investigation is needed to produce a high and stable yield at second harvesting each year, to prevent the accumulation of soil nitrogen, and to assess gaseous nitrogen loss.	0	WOS:000312883500050	49	Cattle feces; Flooded forage rice; Nitrogen; Phyto-purification; Subtropical climate	DRY-MATTER YIELD; CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; WATER-TREATMENT; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; SILAGE; MANURE; JAPAN; TRANSFORMATIONS; MANAGEMENT	Asada, Kei; Nishimura, Taku; Kato, Chihiro; Toyota, Koki; Hosomi, Masaaki	2013	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	19201018; B117

The following five species were observed in the galls of the rice gall midge, Orseolia oryzae (Wood-Mason) on secondary tillers from rice stubbles; Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), Neanastatus cinctiventris Girault (Eupelmidae), Obtusiclava oryzae Subba Rao (Pteromalidae), Platygaster oryzae (Cameron) (Platygastridae), and P. foersteri (Gahan). The species, Eurytoma sp. may possibly be the first record in Sri Lanka, although one specimen of a pupa of Eurytoma sp. was collected at Gampaha District in 1989. P. oryzae and N. cinctiventris were most abundant among these species. The highest percentage parasitism of P. oryzae, i.e. 68.2%, was recorded at a sampling site in Mawatura, Nuwara Eliya District. The highest incidence of N. Cinctiventris took place at sampling sites in Mawanella and Hingula in Kegalla District and percentage parasitism by this parasitoid of the host pupae was 52.1% in this District. From these results, it is concluded that these parasitoids pass through the season, even though rice plants are not cultivated, mainly in the galls on secondary tillers which sprout from rice stubbles.	2	WOS:A1991GN71700011	0	INSECT PEST; EURYTOMA SP; NEANASTATUS-CINCTIVENTRIS; OBTUSICLAVE-ORYZAE; PLATYGASTER-FOERSTERI; PLATYGASTER-ORYZAE	NONE	KOBAYASHI, M; KUDAGAMAGE, C; NUGALIYADDE, L	1991	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

The alterations in rainfall patterns can have considerable feedback on solar radiation, air temperature, and soil moisture which can affect the ecosystem CO2 exchange. In this paper, we assessed the effects of the ENSO events (2008-mid 2010) on the seasonal climate conditions and determined how it affected the gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and net ecosystem production (NEP) of two contrasting rice environments: flooded and non-flooded.; The 2008 dry season (DS) was under a La Nina event while the 2008 wet season (WS) was a neutral one with strong tropical cyclones associated during the wet season. The 2009DS was also La Nina while the 2009WS was El Nino; however, the northern part of the Philippines experienced strong tropical cyclones. The 2010DS was under an El Nino event.; The La Nina in 2008DS resulted in about 15% lower solar radiation (SR), 0.3 degrees C lower air temperature (T-a) and 60% higher precipitation compared to the 28-year climate normal patterns. Both flooded and non-flooded rice fields had lower NEP in 2008 DS (164 and 14 gC m(-2), respectively) than in 2008 WS (295 and 82 gC m(-2), respectively) because the climate anomaly resulted in SR - driven decrease in GPP. The La Nina in 2009DS even resulted in 0.2 degrees C lower air temperature and 40% more precipitation than the 2008DS La Nina. This cooler temperature resulted in lower Re in flooded rice fields while the higher precipitation resulted in higher GPP in non-flooded fields since the climate was favorable for the growth of the aerobic rice, the ratoon crops and the weeds. This climate anomaly benefitted both flooded and non-flooded rice fields by increasing NEP (351 and 218 gC m(-2), respectively). However, NEP decreased in 2009WS in both flooded and non-flooded rice fields (225 and 39 gC m(-2), respectively) due to the devastating effects of the strong tropical cyclones that hit the northern part of the Philippines. On the other hand, the El Nino event during 2010DS resulted in about 6% higher solar radiation, 0.4 degrees C higher air temperature and 67% lower precipitation than the 28-year climate normal pattern. The NEP of flooded and non-flooded rice fields were closely similar at 187 and 174 gC m(-2), respectively. This climate anomaly resulted in T-a - driven increase in Re, as well as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) - driven decrease in GPP in flooded rice fields. The GPP and Re in non-flooded rice fields were less sensitive to higher VPD and higher T-a, respectively. It appears that the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in non-flooded rice field was less sensitive to an El Nino event. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Females were collected from early July to late September 2006 from flooded main crop rice, ratoon crop rice, and a light trap placed in grassy vegetation and fallow fields near Beaumont, TX. Their mating status and ovarian developmental stages were monitored, and their reproductive capacity on rice plants was determined in the laboratory. Sexually reproductive individuals occurred consistently from early July to mid-September, which accounted for more than 50% of the females in most collections. Less than 7% of females seemed to be reproducing parthenogenetically. In the laboratory, 45.1% of females were mated within 9 days after emergence. For females emerging in late July and late August, only 17.4 and 6.1%, respectively, developed to ovipositing and post-ovipositing stages after feeding on rice plants for 4 weeks. These results indicated that in Southeast Texas >80% of summer females entered diapause after emergence, but reproductive females often are abundant later in rice fields. Contributions of summer females to the occurrence and abundance of this insect in subsequent seasons are discussed.	3	WOS:000258096500004	17	NONE	CURCULIONIDAE; COLEOPTERA; ZHEJIANG; CAPACITY; FEMALES; CHINA	Jiang, Mingxing; Way, Michael O.; Du, Xikuan; Ji, Xianghua; He, Yan	2008	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Lowering the main-crop stubble height by harvesting the main crop at a lower than traditional height is believed to alter growth parameters and increase ratoon yields. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of main-crop stubble height on ratoon grain yield, agronomics, and cumulative/weekly panicle growth parameters (density, point of origin, and weight). Main-crop 'Cocodrie' and 'Trenasse' rice cultivars; were harvested to leave either a 40- or 20-cm stubble height. When the main-crop stubble was harvested at 20 cm, ratoon rice grain yield in 2007 was increased by 375 and 190 kg ha(-1) for Cocodrie and Trenasse, respectively. Yield was not improved in 2006 using the low (20 cm) harvest height. The yield advantage in 2007 was associated with the increased weight of the basal panicles when the main crop was harvested at 20 cm. When the main-crop stubble was 20 cm, basal and axial panicle points of origin were numerically similar 5 weeks after main-crop harvest (WAH), while panicles originating from basal nodes were predominant 6 WAH and beyond. In contrast, when the main-crop stubble was 40 cm, approximately 75% of the emerged panicles originated from axial nodes 5 WAH, panicles from both axial and basal points of origin were nearly identical 6 WAH, and basal panicles were dominant thereafter. Results from this study indicate that when the initial stubble height is reduced from 40 to 20 cm the growth of the ratoon crop is altered by shifting panicle point of origin during the early growth period and delaying maturity.

The total estimated whole-plant TDN yield (i.e., of the first crop plus second crop) of Taporuri was the highest in double harvesting. In the first crop, the estimated whole-plant TDN yield of Taporuri was the highest. In the second crop, the estimated whole-plant TDN yield of Taporuri was almost the same as those of Mohretsu and Tachiaoba but higher than that of Hinohikari. We also examined the effects of cultivation method (double harvesting or single harvesting) on estimated TDN yield of forage rice. In Taporuri and Mohretsu, the total estimated whole-plant TDN yield was similar in double harvesting and single harvesting. However, in Tachiaoba and Hinohikari, it was lower in double harvesting than in single harvesting. It is important to maximize the amount of nutrition in leaf and stem rather than panicle because the grain is not digested well by cattle. In the double harvesting, the total estimated leaf blade (leaf) TDN yield of Taporuri was higher than that of Hinohikari and almost the same as those of Tachiaoba and Mohretsu. The total estimated leaf sheath plus stem (stem) TDN yield of Taporuri was the highest. in comparison of the total TDN yield of double harvesting with that of single harvesting, the total estimated leaf and stem TDN yields were higher in double harvesting than in single harvesting in all cultivars except for Hinohikari. Thus, double harvesting of Taporuri is an effective way of reducing the overall loss of nutrition from the crop. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

NONE	NONE	AGRONOMY JOURNAL	RICE RATOON RESPONSE TO MAIN CROP HARVEST CUTTING HEIGHT	NONE	Although main crop rice (Oryza sativa L.)cultural practices are known to influence the subsequent ratoon crop, little specific information is available on the effect of many main crop management practices on ratoon crop performance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of main crop harvest cutting height on ratoon crop agronomic performance, yield, and yield components. The ratoons of both a semidwarf and non-semidwarf southern U.S. long-grain rice cultivars were evaluated in the field for two growing seasons for response to main crop harvest cutting height. Main crop plants were harvested at a cutting height of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m above the soil surface. The semidwarf cultivar had 7 and 40% higher grain yields than the taller cultivar in the main and ratoon crops, respectively. Ratoon plant height and days to 50% heading were numerically different for the two cultivars, but the same in proportion to their main crop traits. Reduced cutting heights delayed ratoon maturity by up to 4 d, but had minimal effects on ratoon plant height. No interactions between cutting height, cultivar, and/or year were found for ratoon yield or yield components. Highest ratoon yields were obtained at cutting heights of 0.2 to 0.3 m. Increasing cutting heights had little effect on ratoon panicle number per meter squared, but significantly decreased filled grain number per panicle, which Led to decreased ratoon yields at the highest two cutting heights. The results show that proper main crop harvest cutting height can increase ratoon yields, but selecting a cultivar with inherent ratooning ability is also essential to successful rice ratooning.	10	WOS:A1993MR54700008	26	NONE	NONE	JONES, DB	1993	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE	
Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Khorasgan Branch, Esfahan, Iran	NONE	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT	Effects of harvesting time and harvesting height on grain yield and agronomical characters in rice ratoon (Oryza sativa L.)	NONE	Rice is the staple food and it is the second most important food in Iran. In order to survey the effects of harvest time and harvest height on grain yield and yield components of rice (Taroem Hasemi variety), an experiment was done in Sari province in 2009. A split plot design within randomized complete block design with 3 replications was used. In this experiment, harvest time was considered as the main factor at two levels (T1 the first harvest on 29(th) August and T2 8(th) September), and harvest height was considered as sub factor (H1 level ground, H2 10 cm, H3 20 cm, H4 30 cm and H5 40 cm). Harvest time had significant effect on grain yield and harvest index. Plant height, flag leaf length, panicle length, straw yield and biological yield were not significantly affected by harvest time. Harvest time and interaction of harvest time and harvesting height had no significant influence on experimental characteristics. On the basis of the results the highest plant height, flag lead length, panicle length, grain yield, straw yield, biological yield and harvest index were obtained on 29(th) August harvesting time. There were no significant differences between harvesting height treatment, but the highest yield was related to harvesting height of 40 cm. The low grain yield of the rice may be attributed to the poor management of cutting height and harvesting time during the cultivation and harvesting period. The results of the survey concluded that the harvesting at 40 cm height on 29(th) August had the potential to produce higher yields.	0	WOS:000300924100089	18	Harvesting time; harvest height; grain yield; agronomical characters; rice	CUTTING HEIGHT; COMPONENTS; HERBICIDES	Yazdpour, Hossein; Shahri, Mohamad Mehdi; Soleymani, Ali; Shahrajabian, Mohamad Hesam	2012	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Wetland rice, sugarcane, banana and coconut showed highly contrasting C storage capacities. Wetland rice and ratoon sugarcane stored 3.1 and 13.1 t C ha(-1), respectively. Banana stored 5.7 t C ha(-1) while nut-bearing coconut stored 24.1 t C ha-l. Of the four agricultural crops examined, coconut was the most stable for C storage, as it is a perennial. Imperata cylindrica (cogon) and Saccharum spontaneum (talahib) were the dominant species in the grassland ecosystem. S. spontaneum and I. cylindrica stored 13.1 and 8.5 t C ha(-1), of which 87% and 60%, respectively, were stored in the shoot system. Due to the common practice of burning crop residues (wetland rice and sugarcane) and controlled burning of grasslands (cogon and talahib), these species were likely to lose a significant portion of their C.	2	WOS:000168690800001	6	carbon storage; grassland and agricultural ecosystems; carbon dioxide; geothermal power	NONE	Lales, JS; Lasco, RD; Geronimo, IQ	2001	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

In this study, an attempt was made to correlate the carbohydrate concentration in stubbles of main crop at harvest, as influenced by fertilizer-management practices, with ratoon yield. The different fertilizer treatments influenced the sugar and starch content in stubbles significantly during both the years. On an average, the sugar (3.7%) and starch (8.25%) content was maximum in recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) + sunnhemp treatment. Similarly, the grain yield of main as well as ratoon crops was also maximum with RDF + sunnhemp treatment (7,142 and 2,123 kg/ha). The correlation coefficients between grain yield of ratoon crop and sugar and starch content in stubbles of main crop were also significant and positive.	1	WOS:000188766300013	6	organic manures; stem carbohydrate and starch; ratoon crop yield	NONE	Manjappa, K; Prabhakar, AS	2003	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE	
Louisiana State Univ, Louisiana Agr Expt Stn, Dept Entomol, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA	NONE	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE	Rice water weevil (Coleoptera : Curculionidae) population dynamics in Louisiana	NONE	The rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel, has long been an important pest of rice in the U.S. and has recently emerged as a pest of rice in Asia. A systematic study of the life history and population dynamics of this insect was conducted during the 2002 growing season at the Louisiana State University Rice Research Station, Crowley, Acadia Parish, LA, an area where it is a particularly severe pest. By monitoring weevil populations using collections from overwintering sites, from plots of rice planted throughout the growing season, and from light traps, and by dissecting collected weevils to assess the conditions of their fat bodies, flight muscles and ovaries, we concluded that a portion of the weevil population in Louisiana is univoltine, another portion is bivoltine, and another portion may pass through multiple generations if young rice is continually available. However, only one generation of weevils developed in a single rice field. Adult weevils invaded rice fields in apparently large numbers prior to flooding. Weevils possessing both well-developed ovaries and well-developed flight muscles were found in both light traps and rice plots, suggesting that adults were capable of seeking new habitats by flying if rice plants were not suitable for oviposition. Weevils were able to complete a generation on ratoon-crop rice. The emergence of overwintered weevils started in late March, with peak emergence occurring during April and May. Return to overwintering sites began in early June and continued until October. Weevils appeared to move among overwintering habitats. A comparison of weevil population dynamics in rice plots planted on different dates supported the use of early planting as a management strategy.	10	WOS:000225282900016	39	Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus; Oryza sativa; population dynamics; ovarian development; flight muscles; fat bodies	ADULT	Shang, HW; Stout, MJ; Zhang, ZT; Cheng, J	2004	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

In this study, we performed a QTL analysis for yield and yield-component traits of an F-2 population based on data from replicated field trials over 2 years using vegetative shoots of ratooned plants, making use of the ratooning habit of rice. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of conducting QTL analyses directly based on an F-2 population by means of ratooning plants. The experimental population was from a cross between 'Zhenshan 97' and 'Minghui 63', the parents of 'Shanyou 63', an elite rice hybrid widely grown in China. Agenetic linkage map containing 151 molecular markers was constructed for QTL I napping. A total of 20 distinct QTLs were detected. eight of these were detected in both years and remaining 12 in only 1 year. Compared with the results of our previous analysis of the F-2:3 families from the same cross, it was shown that most of the QTLs detected in the ratooned F-2 population were also detected in the F-2:3 population. However, the estimates of both additive and dominant types of genetic effects for many of the QTLs based on F-2 ratoons were substantially larger than those based on F-2:3 families. The results indicate that vegetatively ratooned F-2 populations may have considerable utility in the mapping of QTLs, especially if dominant types of gene actions are of concern, although there were certain technical limitations in making use of such populations in the experiments.	38	WOS:000088403800036	20	Oryza sativa L.; ratoon; molecular marker; QTL	DOUBLED-HAPLOID POPULATION; MOLECULAR MAP; ORYZA-SATIVA; POLYMORPHISM; MARKERS; MAIZE	Li, JX; Yu, SB; Xu, CG; Tan, YF; Gao, YJ; Li, XH; Zhang, Q	2000	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

In all, 5 organic nutrition modules involving combinations of organic amendments (sulphitation pressmud and farmyard manure), legume intercrop lentil (Lens culinaris L.) and endophytic/associative diazotrophs (Gluconacetobactor diazotrophicus and Azotobactor chroococum) were tested against control (no manure or fertilizer). Results revealed that supply of nutrients to sugarcane through combined use of sulphitation pressmud 10 tonnes/ha + farmyard manure 10 tonnes/ha gave the highest cane yield (84.6 and 74.2 tonnes/ha for plant and ratoon cane). The treatment also effected significant improvement in soil health at the end of rotation as indicated by 35.2% increase in organic carbon, 158.4% increase in microbial biomass carbon and 118.9% enhancement in soil microbial biomass nitrogen. Besides, the organic nutrition modules resulted in significant increase in the contribution of microbial carbon to soil organic carbon varying from 5.95 to 6.97% against 3.11% of initial value. Soil physical properties were also enhanced as bulk density reduced from 1.34 Mg/m(3) to 1.25 Mg/m(3) or less, water stable aggregates swelled from 0.349 mm diameter to 0.387 mm or more under organic nutrition modules at ratoon harvest. However, farmyard manure 20 tonnes/ha + Trichoderma viride + lentil intercropping (1: 2) proved most profitable (B: C ratio 2.7) for planted crop and sulphitation pressmud 10 tonnes/ha + farmyard manure 10 tonnes/ha for ratoon crop (B: C ratio 3.0).	1	WOS:000265901300004	10	Economics; Organic nutrition; Physical properties; Soil microbial activity; Sugarcane productivity	NONE	Srivastava, T.

Treatment plots contained the semidwarf, early, long-grain rice cultivar Texmont, drill-seeded into a Crowley silt loam soil (Typic Albaqualfs). Main crop treatments were (i) urea (100 kg N ha-1) with rice plants, (ii) urea without plants and (iii) unfertilized plants; ratoon crop treatments consisted of (i) urea (84 kg N ha-1) with plants (ii) urea with plants plus rice straw (10 tons ha-1) and (iii) unfertilized plants. Methane emissions from the microplots were measured over the 77-day first crop and 73-day ratoon crop growing seasons. A closed-chamber technique was used to collect CH4 gas samples in the morning and afternoon hours. Significant urea fertilizer and rice straw effects were observed, and CH4 fluxes were highly variable over the two rice-cropping seasons. Over the main crop-growing season (77 days) approximately 50, 240, and 340 kg of CH4 ha-1 were released to the atmosphere from the urea without plants, unfertilized plants, and urea with plants treatments, respectively. Methane emissions from the ratoon crop (73 days) were 220, 520, and 1,490 kg ha-1 for the unfertilized plants, urea with plants, and urea with plants plus rice straw treatments, respectively. Approximately 1,830 kg of CH4 ha-1 were emitted from the urea-treated planted plots over the 150-day collection period provided the first crop straw was left in the field after harvest.	40	WOS:A1993LP25200006	21	NONE	PADDY FIELDS; FERTILIZER; SOIL	LINDAU, CW; BOLLICH, PK	1993	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

The total leaf number of each tiller in the ratoon crop was compared with Katayama's theoretical total number of leaves. The ratoon crop produced about 30% of the grain yield of the parent crop. Fertilization of the ratoon crop increased the panicle number per hill, resulting in an increased yield, Ratoon tillers were separated from the main stem to determine their tillering position on the seem, and to find the effect of fertilization on regrowth of tillers. Yield increase by fertilization was mainly due to the increase in the number of ripened secondary tillers. Tillers had 2 similar to 3 more leaves than the total leaves expected from the theory of synchronous growth of leaves and tillers. The investigation of growth of lateral buds at each growth stage of the parent crop showed that the relation between growth of the main stem and lateral bud growth of ratoon tillers was not synchronized, resulting in the increase of total leaf number over the theoretical one.	2	WOS:A1995QM26400001	0	DIFFERENTIATION; EARLY-SEASON CULTURE; LATERAL BUD; RATOON; REGROWTH; TILLER	NONE	YOSHIDA, T; HOZONO, S	1995	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Previous studies have shown that the Sathi rice variety (an indica-type) shows high allelopathic potential (HAP), whereas the Nongan rice variety (a japonica-type) shows low allelopathic potential (LAP). Hence, in this study, we assessed the F6 and F7 generations of 180 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from crossing Nongan/Sathi planted in Seoul, Korea. A laboratory assessment (double pots allelopathy bioassay) and a field assessment (rice ratoon interplanting barnyardgrass seedling) were used to screen the allelopathic potential of the rice cross. Both methods used barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli Beauv. var. frumentaceae) as a plant (weed) indicator to evaluate how rice suppressed plant growth. The results indicated that some prospective lines have HAP, exhibiting high suppression of barnyardgrass height and shoot dry-weight. Further selection for desired agronomical characteristics was performed for F8 RILs in the field in Korea, with some selected F9 lines exhibiting HAP and LAP during repeated planting in Bogor, Indonesia. The allelopathic potential of the Nongan/Sathi rice cross was confirmed on F10 RILs by evaluating agronomic performance. Through this multi-generation work, some promising lines derived from japonica and indica rice-types exhibiting high and low allelopathic traits, may be used in closely monitored agronomic field trials.	1	WOS:000313455900002	19	Allelopathy; barnyardgrass; breeding; Echinochloa crusgalli; low input; rice; screening; sustainable weed management	ORYZA-SATIVA; IDENTIFICATION; BARNYARDGRASS; SUBSTANCE	Junaedi, A.; Chozin, M.

Sugarcane yields were significantly greater in the Sesbania rotation than in the other because of a larger N uptake. N uptake of the crop was significantly affected by soil organic carbon, and available N and K contents. Ratoon yields? however, were largest in the cowpea sequence followed by the rice rotation, probably due to a prolonged residual effect of cowpea and rice root residues. The residual effect of a Sesbania green manure was negligible as demonstrated by the low NO3-N content of the soil profile after sugarcane harvest compared to the other two crop sequences. The total cane productivity (main sugarcane plus ratoon) was greater (156 t ha(-1)) in the cowpea rotation than the Sesbania (152 t ha(-1)) and rice (140 t ha(-1)) rotations.	1	WOS:A1997XF44100008	16	crop rotation; farmyard manure; fertilizer-N; green manure; nitrate leaching; organic matter; sugarcane	MINERALIZATION; RICE; RESIDUES; NITRATE	Yadav, RL; Prasad, SR	1997	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

The Sesbania-sugarcane-ratoon rotation added 14.48 t ha(-1) biomass to the soil compared with 4.81 t ha(-1) by the rice-sugarcane-ratoon rotation because Sesbania yielded a significantly greater biomass (11.12 t ha(-1)) than did the residual rootmass of rice (1.68 t ha(-1)) and sugarcane (2.64-3.83 t ha(-1)). Soil organic carbon, however, tended to decline after green manuring with Sesbania but gradually increased after incorporation of rice-root residues.

The identification of an appropriate technology with low input, such as ratooning, would allow this niche to be utilized. Field experiments were conducted at the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 cropping seasons to evaluate the performance of the main and ratooned crops of lowland NERICA (New Rice for Africa) rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties in a lowland rice-ratooned rice-fluted pumpkin (Telfairia occidentalis Hook F.) sequence. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The lowland rice varieties used were NERICA-L 19, NERICA-L 20, NERICA-L 22, NERICA-L 24, OFADA, NERICA-L 26, NERICA-L 41, NERICA-L 42, NERICA-L 44 and NERICA-L 47. The grain yield of the main rice crop ranged from 5.0 to 7.3 t ha(-1) in 2007-2008 cropping season and from 4.1 to 9.1 t ha(-1) in 2008-2009. The ratooned rice had a grain yield of 1.0-4.7 t ha(-1) in 2007-2008 and 1.2-3.4 t ha(-1) in 2008-2009. The total grain yield obtained in 2007-2008 from the main and ratooned rice crops in seven months was 6.7-11.6 t ha(-1), while in 2008-2009 it was 5.3-2.6 t ha(-1). The fresh leaf yield of fluted pumpkin ranged from 14.6 to 16.9 t ha(-1) in 2007-2008 and from 18.3 to 19.8 t ha(-1) in 2008-2009, similar to previously reported rainy season unfertilized yields. Thus, a ratooned rice crop appears to be a feasible technology capable of boosting rice production and consequently increasing the overall productivity of the inland valley in a rice-rice-vegetable cropping sequence.	0	WOS:000309098900007	26	NONE	NONE	Adigbo, S.

A field experiment on double cropping of rice was conducted under mid- altitude subtropical wetland valley ecosystem of Meghalaya from 2004-05 to 2005-06 at Umiam (950 m amsl), Meghalaya. Out of the six varieties tested, IR-64 (43.2 q/ha), Aerobic rice IR 72176 (42.1 q/ha) and Krishna Hamsha (40.5 q/ha) performed well during pre-kharif season. Double cropping (main + ratoon) of IR-64 produced 75.4 q/ha of grain yield compared to 40.5 q/ha under improved monocropping of rice variety Sahsarang-1. Ratooning could save time (nursery and field preparation, transplanting, etc.), resources (labour, seeds, etc.) and gave higher productivity. The ratooning ability of Sahsarang1 (33.0 q/ha) and IR-64 (32.2 q/ha) was found to be highly promising. The sequence IR- 64 in pre-kharif followed by its ratoon also gave 86 and 202% higher productivity over improved (40.5 q/ha) and local practice (25.0 q/ha) of monocropping respectively. It was found equally good with the best combination of IR- 64 in pre-kharif followed by late kharif transplanted crop of Vivek Dhan-82 (system productivity of 80.4 q grain/ha). Duration of main crop varied from 135 to 158 days, whereas in case of ratoon it varied from 70 to 95 days. Therefore, it was concluded that ratooning has ample opportunity, especially in the NER region of India, where climatic conditions and non-availability of resources restrict the double cropping of rice by the farmers. The practice of double cropping would not only add to the national food basket, but would also increase the farmers' income and generate more employment in the region.	3	WOS:000272326900022	24	Mid-altitude; mono and double cropping; organic production; ratooning; rice; subtropical wetlands	NONE	Munda, G.

It is suggested that under most conditions, a ratoon is more cost-effective than double cropping (strongly favoured by the Republic's rice officials), at both micro- and macro-level.  Therefore, a re-examination of the official view on rice cropping systems is recommended, as well as the incorporation of the ratoon in programmes directed at the development of new rice technology.	1	WOS:A1991FE31400013	13	RICE; CROPPING SYSTEMS; RATOON; ADAPTIVE RESEARCH	NONE	DOORMAN, F	1991	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE	
Louisiana State Univ, Rice Res Stn, Ctr Agr, Rayne, LA 70578 USA	10.2135/cropsoc2006.09.0592	CROP SCIENCE	Field evaluation of imidazolinone-tolerant clearfield rice (Oryza sativa L.) at nine Louisiana locations	NONE	Clearfield rice (Oryza satva L.) developed at the Rice Research Station, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, offers a first-ever non- genetically modified alternative to selectively eliminate notorious red rice (O. sativa L.) in a commercial rice field. The objective of this study,, was to compare Clearfield rice with the leading conventional cultivars for grain yield (main and ratoon crops), milling yield, seedling vigor, maturity, plant height, and disease reactions by analyzing the Louisiana rice commercial advanced yield test that was conducted at nine locations during 2003 to 2004. Our results indicate that the grain yields of Clearfield cultivars were significantly lower-than the leading conventional long-grain cultivars such as Cocodrie, Cheniere, Wells, and Francis; The average main crop grain yield of Clearfield rice was about 11.1 and 5.5% lower than that of conventional cultivars in 2003 I and 2004, respectively. However, Clearfield cultivars exhibited higher head rice yield than the leading conventional ones. No significant difference on ratoon yield was found between Clearfield rice and conventional rice. Clearfield rice also h ad similar maturity and plant height,as : conventional cultivars but better seedling vigor. Compared with conventional rice, Clearfield cultivars appeared to be more susceptible to both sheath blight and blast. The yield gap between Clearfield and conventional cultivars has been significantly reduced with the release of newer Clearfield cultivars CL161 and CL131.	12	WOS:000247424200031	31	NONE	YIELD; GLYPHOSATE; REGISTRATION; IMAZETHAPYR; CULTIVAR	Sha, X.

Although birds in other agro-ecosystems may perform biological control services by controlling insect pests, the potential of blackbirds to provide these services in rice had not been evaluated. We used bird exclosures to evaluate the effects of blackbirds on stink bugs in rice and on crop damage and yields in the Everglades Agricultural Area in southern Florida. Experiments were conducted in both the main rice crop and the ratoon crop. We found no difference in the abundance of rice stink bugs (Oebalus spp.) in exclosures vs. controls, indicating that predation by birds did not reduce stink bug populations. Damage to rice by stink bugs (pecky rice) was similar between exclosures and controls, as well. However, bird damage, quantified as the percentage of panicles damaged, differed by as much as an order of magnitude in exclosures vs. controls. Mean damage estimates were 3.5% in the bird exclosures vs. 35.3% in the control for the main crop and 4.5% and 20.5%, respectively, in the exclosures and controls for the ratoon crop. Nonetheless, mean yields did not differ between exclosures and controls. Our results suggest that despite their conspicuous presence, blackbirds have little effect on stink bug populations or rice yield in Florida rice fields.	0	WOS:000301867000022	33	biological control; exclosures; pecky rice; wildlife damage control	RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS; REGISTERED PESTICIDES; PEST; ESTABLISHMENT; PREDATORS; LOUISIANA; COFFEE; BIRDS	Borkhataria, Rena R.; Nuessly, Gregg S.; Pearlstine, Elise; Cherry, Ron H.	2012	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

The highest total dry matter yield was 27.1 t ha(-1). We examined the effects of two times of first harvest (booting stage versus full heading stage). Plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 50% higher dry matter yield of first crop than those harvested at the booting stage, because the plants had greater weights per tiller than those harvested at the booting stage. Plants harvested at the booting stage produced 37% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those harvested at the full heading stage, because the plants had greater dry weights per tiller than those harvested at the full heading stage. Overall, plants harvested at the full heading stage produced 8% higher total dry matter yield than those harvested at the booting stage. We also examined the effects of two total amounts of nitrogen (300 kg N ha(-1) versus 150 kg N ha(-1)) and three nitrogen application methods (method 1: 33.3% applied at transplanting, 66.7% at the maximum tiller number stage, 0.0% at 7 days after the first harvest, and 0.0% at 21 days after the first harvest; method 2: 33.3, 33.3, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively; method 3: 33.3, 0.0, 33.3%, and 33.3%, respectively). For the first crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha(-1) produced 10% higher dry matter yield than those that received 150 kg N ha(-1) in 2004. Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 produced 21% and 23% higher dry matter yield of first crop than plants that underwent method 3, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha(-1) treatment and in nitrogen application methods 1 and 2 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of first crop in these treatments. For the second crop, plants that received 300 kg N ha(-1) produced 10% higher dry matter yield of second crop than those that received 150 kg N ha(-1). Plants that underwent nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 produced 57% and 56% higher dry matter yield of second crop than method 1, respectively. The increase in number of tillers per meter in the 300 kg N ha(-1) treatment and in nitrogen application methods 2 and 3 resulted in the higher dry matter yields of second crop in these treatments. Overall, plants that received 300 kg N ha(-1) produced 7% higher dry matter yield than those that received 150 kg N ha(-1) and plants that underwent nitrogen application method 2 produced 21% and 11% higher dry matter yield than those that underwent methods 1 and 3, respectively. Therefore, our findings suggest that to produce the highest total dry matter yield the best time for first harvest is the full heading stage and the best nitrogen management is to provide 300 kg N ha(-1) in accordance with nitrogen application method 2.

In these trials, paraquat and sodium chlorate were applied 7 and 3 d prior to main-crop rice harvest (pre-harvest). In the first study, the rice cultivars Cocodrie, Cypress, and Wells responded differently to desiccants. Paraquat could be an effective desiccant for rice, but dose, application timing, and cultivar must be taken into account prior to its use. In the second study, both doses of sodium chlorate applied 7 d pre-harvest reduced head rice yield, but only the dose of 6.7 kg/ha reduced head rice yield when applied 3 d pre-harvest. Sodium chlorate should be applied to rice as a desiccant at 4.5 kg/ha no earlier than 3 d pre-harvest to avoid losses in grain yield and quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental design was a split-split plot with randomized complete block design with three replications. Accordingly, three levels of N (0, 35 and 70 kg ha(-1)) in main plots, two planting dates of berseem clover (coincident with main crop harvest and 40 days after it) in sub plots and two harvesting heights (10 and 40 cm above the soil surface) in sub-sub plots were laid out. The application of 70 kg N ha(-1) and short harvest height (10 cm) yielded the highest ratoon rice grain, ratoon days to 50% heading and harvest index. The best biological yield was obtained from higher harvest height as well. Qualitative traits such as gelatinization temperature (GT) and protein content (PC) increased with large amount of N. But amylose content (AC) and gel consistency (GC) were not affected by experimental treatments. Effect of nitrogen and harvest height on fresh and dry weight of both cuts, protein content in the first cutting and total land equivalent ratio (LER) were significant at 1% level. The highest fresh and dry weight yield was obtained by application of 35 kg N ha(-1). The highest protein and total LER obtained from higher N application (70 kg N ha(-1)). All studied traits had the highest value in shorter harvest height and the first planting date of berseem clover.	2	WOS:000292570600010	61	Nitrogen; Harvest height; Intercropping; Berseem clover; Ratoon rice	FORAGE YIELD; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; CUTTING HEIGHT; TROPICAL RICE; DRY-MATTER; HAY YIELD; BARLEY; MIXTURES; QUALITY; GROWTH	Petroudi, Elyas Rahimi; Noormohammadi, Ghorban; Mirhadi, Mohammad Javad; Madani, Hamid; Mobasser, Hamid Reza	2011	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

A study was undertaken from December 2009 until December 2010 in the Ayeyarwady River Delta, the major lowland rice-producing area of Myanmar, to monitor the population dynamics of M. graminicola and H. oryzae in a naturally infested field. Root samples of the two rice varieties Yatanartoe and Taungpyan that are commonly cultivated in double rice-cropping sequences in Myanmar and represent irrigated and rainfed lowland rice varieties, respectively, were obtained for nematode analysis. During the summer-irrigated rice-growing season the root population density of second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. graminicola showed two distinct peaks at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants in January and at the heading stage of the rice plants in March 2010. With the onset of the monsoon rains, the J2 population densities in the roots of ratoon rice plants gradually decreased in May. During the rainfed monsoon rice-growing season, very low population densities of M. graminicola J2 were detected in the roots of rice plants, while the root population density of H. oryzae juveniles and adults showed two distinct peaks at the maximum tillering stage of the rice plants in August and at the heading stage of the rice plants in October 2010. With the onset of the dry season, population density of H. oryzae in the roots reached the lowest density at harvest in November. Root galling caused by M. graminicola followed the same trend as the J2 population densities throughout the irrigated season. No root galls were observed during the monsoon season. Our results can be used for practical purposes aimed at a better management of both M. graminicola and H. oryzae.	2	WOS:000325194400004	62	growing season; naturally infested field; population density; rice root-knot nematode; rice root nematode; root galling	ROOT-PARASITIC NEMATODES; HETERODERA-TRIFOLII; WHITE CLOVER; ANNUAL CYCLE; SOIL TYPE; PHILIPPINES; TOLERANCE; CULTIVARS; PASTURE; VIETNAM	Win, Pa Pa; Kyi, Pyone Pyone; Maung, Zin Thu Zar; De Waele, Dirk	2013	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Research was conducted to determine the effect of length of drain period at main-crop harvest on ratoon rice productivity on an Everglades Histosol. Our research was conducted in 250-L (0.95 m height, 0.58 m i.d.) custom-made water control lysimeters filled with a Pahokee muck soil (euic, hyperthermic Lithic Medisaprist). Ratoon reflood timing treatments were 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 d drained beginning at main-crop maturity. Ratoon-crop grain yield exhibited a significant quadratic response to length of drain period with maximum grain yield produced at 28 d drained. Ratoon panicle number was not affected by reflood timing, but quadratic responses to length of drain period were observed for grain number and 1000-grain weight. We propose that the resultant effect of reflood timing on ratoon grain yield was the combined responses to increasing mineral N supply and increasing water stress associated with delayed reflooding. For drained durations <28 d, the beneficial effects of increased mineral N supply resulting from organic matter oxidation resulted in a net increase in ratoon-crop yield. Conversely, for drained periods >28 d, the detrimental impact of prolonged water stress dominated the response to reflood timing and ratoon rice yields declined.	3	WOS:A1994NU49400003	21	NONE	NONE	COALE, FJ; JONES, DB	1994	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Thus, the objective of the present study is to measure arsenic content in different parts of rice and paddy soils, and eventually explain the arsenic distribution in ratoon rice, including its relationship to the soil. Arsenic levels of rice in grains, straws, roots, and soils were obtained from 15 rice paddies, selected based on different arsenic soil concentrations ranging from 67 to 438 mg kg(-1) (n = 15). The mean arsenic content in grains was measured at 0.20 mg kg(-1) (n = 60) and the highest grain arsenic of the survey was at 1.183 mg kg(-1). Meanwhile, the mean total arsenic levels were 244 mg kg(-1) (n = 28) in root and 4.4 mg kg(-1) (n = 28) in straw. In comparison, regression of topsoil arsenic levels with rice grains (r (2) = 0.00) and straws (r (2) = 0.56) were less significant compared to that with rice roots (r (2) = 0.93), and the mean arsenic level in rice from root to grain was also shown to have a decreasing trend. Though concentrations of arsenic in compositive rice grain each field did not exceed food hygiene concentration limit, arsenic level in root strongly depended on arsenic concentrations of soil suggesting that the high arsenic concentration may have the potential for translocation from root to grain which ultimately effects on the human health.	0	WOS:000347290600002	39	Arsenic; FPXRF; Rice; Soil contamination	ORYZA-SATIVA L.; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; DRINKING-WATER; HEALTH RISK; PADDY SOIL; BANGLADESH; GROUNDWATER; METABOLISM; VEGETABLES; INDIA	Lin, S. -C.; Chang, T. -K.; Huang, W. -D.; Lur, H. -S.; Shyu, G. -S.	2015	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Organic matter (OM) and total N in the soil not only increased more after cowpea (OM = 0 . 78%, N = 0 . 048%) compared with rice (OM = 0 . 66%, N = 0 . 024% but also remained at a higher level throughout the crop sequence. Time of N application to sugarcane did not influence significantly the OM and N contents of the soil. However, placement of N at 15 cm depth along stubble rows in the ratoon crop improved the OM and N contents of the soil more than the top dressing of N. Sugarcane yields were significantly higher in cowpea-plant cane-ratoon cane rotation than those in the rice-plant cane-ratoon cane rotation. Split applications of N at 45 and 90 days after planting produced a significantly higher plant-cane yield than other split applications, but did not influence ratoon-cane yield significantly.	6	WOS:A1995QX60300021	14	CROP RESIDUE; CROP-ROTATIONS; ORGANIC MATTER; SOIL N; SUGARCANE	QUALITY; YIELD	YADAV, RL; VERMA, RP	1995	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

In this study, we examined the seasonal occurrence of L. striatellus in an agricultural area in central Kyushu in which cropping systems have been changing since the 1970s. The first generation of L. striatellus emerged in the spring, not only on barley, oats, and Italian ryegrass but also on spring crops of forage maize. The second generation of L. striatellus adults emerged in forage maize fields in July, after harvesting of winter crops of barley, oats, and Italian ryegrass. These results suggest that spring crops of forage maize are important hosts of L. striatellus from spring to early summer. The overwintering generation of L. striatellus was collected from rice ratoon, suggesting this is a favorable host for L. striatellus during winter. The appearance of these novel hosts may be a factor in the recent re-emergence of L. striatellus in central Kyushu.	0	WOS:000340492500014	31	Rice stripe virus; Forage maize; Seasonal occurrence; Rice ratoon; Yellow sticky trap	SMALL BROWN PLANTHOPPER; MAIZE ORANGE LEAFHOPPER; STRIPE DISEASE; CHINA; CICADELLIDAE; MIGRATION; FALLEN	Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Matsukura, Keiichiro; Sakai, Junichi; Onuki, Masatoshi; Sanada-Morimura, Sachiyo; Towata, Tomomi; Matsumura, Masaya	2014	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	42120

Sampling in three outbreak areas during 1994 showed that the insect's annual cycle varied according to the agroecological zone and rice cropping pattern. In the humid forest zone, Orseolia oryzivora persisted through the short dry season on ratoons of cultivated rice Oryza sativa at a rainfed site and on dry season rice crops at an irrigated one. In contrast, at rainfed sites in the moist savannah zone the pest survived the longer dry season on the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata, while ratoons and volunteers of O. sativa provided 'bridges' between the wild host and wet season rice crops. Early in the wet season at rainfed sites, galls of Orseolia oryzivora were not found at high density on wild rice, ratoons or volunteers. The heavy infestations which developed by October resulted primarily from rapid multiplication on rice crops themselves during the wet season. At all 13 sites sampled, the large majority of galls were found on fallow or cropped rice fields, rather than in ditches, bunds or uncultivated wetland, irrespective of the time of year or the hosts involved. From gall dissections, the parasitoids Aprostocetus procerae (Risbec) and Platygaster diplosisae Risbec caused over 30% mortality at some sites by October but generally increased too late to prevent crop damage. Implications of the results for the management of Orseolia oryzivora are discussed.	5	WOS:000086387600012	20	NONE	BURKINA-FASO; HARRIS; GAGNE	Williams, CT; Okhidievbie, O; Harris, KM; Ukwungwu, MN	1999	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Substantial cost is associated with application of slag.  Thus, it is important to know whether yields of successive ratoon crops of sugarcane respond to residual soil Si applied as slag.  Our objective was to determine the long-term response of sugarcane grown on a Terra Ceia muck (euic, hyperthermic Typic Medisaprist) at two locations in the Everglades Agricultural Area to slag applied (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 Mg ha-1) before either a rice (Oryza sativa L.)/sugarcane rotation or immediately before sugarcane.  Slag increased cane and sugar yields as well as tissue Si concentrations.  Application of 20 Mg slag ha-1 increased cumulative cane yields as much as 39% and sugar yields as much as 50% over the three crop years.  Yield response to slag was generally greater from application immediately prior to sugarcane planting than to the preceding rice rotation crop.  Without slag, ratoon yield production decreased as much as 45% in cane and 50% in sugar, whereas with slag, yields decreased only 28% in cane and 29% in sugar.  Our data indicate that the critical level for leaf Si may be greater than the previously reported value of 10 g kg-1, and that reduced yields in ratoon crops vs. plant crops were associated with lower Si levels.  Consequently, more extensive Si deficiencies may exist in the Everglades than were previously considered.  Other yield-limiting factors such as low soil Mg concentrations were also shown to contribute to the decline of sugarcane ratoon yields.	18	WOS:A1991GG70600019	22	NONE	RICE; ROTATION	ANDERSON, DL; SNYDER, GH; MARTIN, FG	1991	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

The influence of main crop total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) and main crop N topdressing on ratoon crop yield of four contrasting field-grown rice cultivars were evaluated in Texas during 1988 and 1989. Allowing panicles to develop normally or removing the upper two-thirds of each main crop panicle 10 d after initial main crop heading created a range in TNC of the culm and leaves during later stages of main crop development for determining TNC effects on ratooning. Nitrogen applied 10 d after initial main crop heading corrected any possible N deficiency, but did not increase main crop yield, TNC, or ratoon crop yield, indicating no benefits to N applied immediately after main crop heading. During main crop grain filling, culm and leaf TNC levels of plants with normal panicles decreased to low levels (0-90 g kg-1), then gradually increased and ranged from 40 to 170 g kg-1 at harvest. In contrast, TNC in culms and leaves of plants with incomplete panicles gradually increased during main crop grain filling reaching 140 to 310 g kg-1 at main crop harvest. Main crop plants with elevated TNC levels produced ratoon yields up to 5.3 Mg ha-1, averaging 48 and 33% higher than plants with low TNC at main crop harvest in 1988 and 1989, respectively. These data illustrate a moderate positive correlation (R2 = 0.66) between ratoon yields and TNC in culm and leaves at main crop harvest for effects due to years, panicle removal, and cultivars.	12	WOS:A1993KT47500027	16	NONE	NONE	TURNER, FT; JUND, MF	1993	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

However, Oryza spp. cannot be screened in the field as is done for cultivated rice (O. sativa) because the plant canopy does not favor disease development and many plants drop mature seed. Thus, a growth chamber-greenhouse method of screening Oryza spp. and their early generation progeny is needed. Primary-secondary and ratoon tillers of rice cultivars-germplasm which ranged from moderately resistant to very susceptible were evaluated first for sheath blight susceptibility. Plants were inoculated by placing R. solani-colonized toothpicks at the leaf collar, then incubating plants in a growth chamber. After 7 days, plants were visually rated for sheath blight severity, and the lesion length of each leaf was measured. Ranking of cultivar-germplasm susceptibility by visual rating of primary-secondary tillers corresponded to the ranking from field ratings. Visual ratings correlated best with combined lesion length of the second and third leaves. For ratoon tillers, visual ratings correlated best with second-leaf lesion length. Next, this method was used with ratoon tillers to evaluate sheath blight susceptibility of 21 Oryza spp. accessions and F-1 progeny from crosses between 17 accessions and cultivated rice. This method proved useful on a limited scale for screening germplasm that could not be evaluated under field conditions.	25	WOS:000176362500019	28	Thanatephorus cucumeris	RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; CULTIVATED RICE; REGISTRATION	Eizenga, GC; Lee, FN; Rutger, JN	2002	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

Islamic Azad Univ, Khorasgan Esfahan Branch, Dept Agron & Plant Breeding, Esfahan, Iran	NONE	RESEARCH ON CROPS	Yield and yield components of ratoon crop of rice as influenced by harvesting at different plant height and time	NONE	In order to survey the effects of harvest time and harvest height on grain yield and yield components of rice (Taroem Hasemi variety), an experiment was done in Sari province in 2009. A split plot design within randomized complete block design with three replications was used. In this experiment, harvest time was considered as the main factor at two levels (T-1 : The first harvest on 29 August and 8 September), and harvest height was considered as sub-factor (H-1 : Level ground, H-2 : 10 cm, H-3 : 20 cm, H-4: 30 cm and H-5 : 40 cm). The effect of harvesting time was significant on the number of days from plantation until 50% of flowering, the number of fertile tillers, the number of panicles per m(2), the number of filled spikelets and grain yield. Harvesting height had significant influence on the number of tillers, the number of fertile tillers, the number of panicles per m(2) and the number of filled spikelets. The number of tillers, the number of fertile tillers, the number of panicles per m(2) and the number of filled spikelets were significantly affected by harvesting time and harvesting height interaction. The highest number of days from plantation until 50% of flowering, plant height, the number of tillers, the number of fertile tillers, the number of panicles per m(2), the number of spikelets per spike, the number of filled spikelets, 1000-grain weight and grain yield were related to plantation on 29 August. The low grain yields of the rice may be attributed to the poor management of cutting height and harvesting time during the cultivation and harvesting period. The results of the survey concluded that the harvesting at 40 cm height and harvesting on 29 August had the potential to produce higher yields.	0	WOS:000309437800002	9	Harvest height; harvest time; rice; yield; yield components	NONE	Shahri, Mohamad Mehdi; Yazdpour, Hossein; Soleymani, Ali; Shahrajabian, Mohamad Hesam; Sharifianzadeh, Maedeh	2012	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 rice)	NONE

The number of tillers, millable cane count, sugarcane and sugar yield were significantly increased at higher level of N when applied with organic manure where as the effect of biogas slurry (BGS) was found more pronounced. Similarly, juice quality was also significantly enhanced at higher N level in conjoint with BGS. The nutrient uptake (N, P, K and Zn) by sugarcane crop was highest in treatment T-4 (100 % NPK + 20 t BGS/ha). The bulk density varied from 1.36 to 1.48 g/cm(3) and lowest bulk density was found in treatment T-8 (100 % NPK + 10 t ST + 10 t SPM/ha) and higher pore space and water holding capacity were also recorded in treatment T-8 (100 % NPK + 10 t ST + 10 t SPM/ha). The available N, P and K content in post harvest soil of sugarcane crop was increased with increasing N levels alone or along with organic manures. The correlation between physico-chemical properties of post harvest soil with yield and quality parameters of sugarcane was positive and significant.	0	WOS:000327935800003	16	Quality parameter; Calcareous soil; Nutrient availability; Biogas slurry; Sugarcane yield	PLANT-RATOON SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; SEQUENCE; MANURE	Umesh, U.

Oil seed crops, viz sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czenj. and Cosson] after rice showed poor economic return than cereal and legume crop. Rice-mustard-maize + cowpea (F) was the poorest. The labour-employment generation was the highest (552 man-days/ha/year) against sugarcane-ratoon, followed by banana-banana system. Rice-sunflower-maize + cowpea (fodder) resulted higher labour employment generation, among the rice-based cropping sequences.

Moench] varieties, Speedfeed and KFS4, to salinity and irrigation frequency were studied from January to December 2009. The two varieties were grown under salinity levels of 0, 5, 10 and 15 dS m(-1) and irrigated when the leaf water potential reached -1 (control), -1.5 and -2 MPa. Salinity and irrigation frequency significantly affected stem diameter, number of tillers, plant height, total leaf area and cumulative dry matter yield of ratoon forage sorghum (P<0.01). Low soil water (-2 MPa) reduced plant height in non-saline and medium saline conditions by 33.4 and 28.9%, respectively, whereas in highly saline soil there was 34.4% reduction in plant height even at medium water stress (-1.5 MPa). Maximum number of tillers (2.48 tillers plant(-1)) was produced in non-saline soil. Low soil water content and high salinity reduced the number of tillers produced. Total leaf area of plants also decreased with increasing salinity and irrigation interval. Overall Speedfeed variety had stems with a smaller mean diameter than KFS4 and produced a higher number of tillers than KFS4. Regardless of variety, leaf firing increased with increasing salinity, reaching 59.95% in the extreme salinity treatment of 15 dS m(-1), and it increased with increasing water stress reaching 48.77% in the extreme water stress treatment of -2 MPa. However, there was less water deficit and salinity injury noticeable in KFS4 at all irrigation levels compared to Speedfeed. Most of the decline in growth parameters was significant only at -2 MPa irrigation frequency which means irrigation of forage sorghum can be withheld till leaf water potential reaches -1.5 MPa.	0	WOS:000297660700010	18	Salinity; leaf water potential; morphology; forage re-growth; Sorghum bicolor	TOLERANCE; SALT	Saberi, Ali Reza; Hassan, Siti Aishah; Abd Halim, Ridzwan; Rahman, Zaharah Abdul	2011	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum)	NONE

Moench] while maintaining silage yield. In a 1-yr preliminary study, first-cut sorghum was harvested at mid-vegetative, late-vegetative, boot, bloom, and hard-dough stages of maturity. Regrowth was harvested in late August. In a 2-yr experiment, yield, ensiling losses, intake, and in vivo apparent digestibility of vegetative sorghum (initial and ratoon cuts wilted 24 h) were compared with direct cut hard-dough-stage sorghum. Forages were stored in 1.8-Mg-capacity (fresh wt.) experimental sites and, upon opening, were fed to lambs (Ovis aries). Results from the preliminary experiment indicated that dry matter (DM) yield of first-cut sorghum was greatest at the hard-dough stage; however, nutritional value was greatest for the mid-vegetative stage. Maximum yield for the combined harvests was obtained when first harvest was made at boot stage, The 2-yr experiment average DM yields were 7.3 Mg ha(-1) for combined initial (mid-vegetative stage) and ratoon crops, compared with 6.7 Mg ha(-1) for the single hard-dough-stage harvest. Ensiling losses did not differ with harvest regime. Vegetative sorghum was more digestible than sorghum harvested at the hard-dough stage (670 vs, 570 g kg(-1)). These studies suggest that sorghum harvested twice per season (with wilting) will produce a higher quality silage than a single hard-dough stage cutting, without yield reduction.	10	WOS:A1995TB50400030	30	NONE	LIGNIN	MCCORMICK, ME; MORRIS, DR; ACKERSON, BA; BLOUIN, DC	1995	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum)	NONE

In this savanna area, each year comprises 2 seasons-dry (April-September) and rainy (October-March). Seed crops were sown almost every month for 1 yr, and each seed cropping was followed by a ratoon cropping after the seed crop harvest. The stem-related traits of plants from different sowing or ratooning dates were studied at around 17 weeks after sowing or ratooning. For both plants derived from seed and ratoon, better crop establishment was observed when cultivation was commenced during the rainy season than during the dry season. Although sowing was undertaken each week in August and September during the most severe dry period, germination rate was very low (or zero) and even the germinated plants died within a short time. In contrast, ratoon cropping was started and plants were grown until harvest. In East Java, it is considered possible to produce sweet sorghum throughout the year, mainly by sowing, but also partially by ratooning during the most severe drought period of the dry season.	5	WOS:000257447900016	16	dry season; Indonesia; monosodium glutamate; rainy season; ratoon; savanna; sweet sorghum; year-round cultivation	DRY	Tsuchihashi, Naoyuki; Goto, Yusuke	2008	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum)	NONE

NONE	NONE	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY	SEASONAL ABUNDANCE OF THE STEM BORER CHILO-PARTELLUS (LEPIDOPTERA, PYRALIDAE) AND ITS PARASITES ON SUMMER GRAIN CROPS	NONE	The seasonal abundance of a lepidopteran stem borer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe), and its parasites was studied at Brits in maize and grain sorghum from 1985 to 1989, and from 1985 to 1986 at Warmbaths, South Africa.  C. partellus generations overlapped, and all developmental stages were present throughout most of the summer (November-March).  The borer completed two and a half generations per season.  The first generation occurred during October-November, infesting only early grain sorghum tillers from a ratoon crop.  C. partellus produced an additional one and a half generations on the commercial crops that emerged later.  In March-April, fifth and sixth instars of the third generation entered diapause in the dry stalks.  During the second part of August, the larvae started to emerge from diapause and all had pupated or emerged as adults by October-November.  Diapausing larvae were present during most of the year.  An increase in the proportion of young larvae indicated an increase in the population, and an increase in the proportion of pupae indicated a decline.  Infestation by borers started on the funnel leaves and then moved down in the stalks as the season progressed.  The majority of winter larvae diapaused in the lower parts of stalks.  Pupal parasitism generally peaked at 100% and this corresponded with a decline of the first-generation larvae.  The most abundant pupal parasites were Dentichasmias busseolae Heinrich at Brits, and Pediobius furvus (Gahan) at Warmbaths.  Larval parasitism lagged behind peak larval populations and peaked at 80% parasitism.  The most abundant larval parasite of C. partellus was Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron).  Most recorded parasites are indigenous to Africa and their association with the exotic C. partellus is relatively new.  Although they reduced densities of C. partellus, parasites did not reduce densities below economic damage levels.	34	WOS:A1992HL67100036	22	INSECTA; CHILO-PARTELLUS; STEM BORER, PARASITOID	SPOTTED STALK BORER; SOUTH-AFRICA; SORGHUM; DIAPAUSE; RELEASE; MAIZE	KFIR, R	1992	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum)	NONE

NONE	NONE	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA	Competitive displacement of Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) by Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)	NONE	Since the appearance of the stem borer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) on the African continent in 1932, it has continuously expanded its distribution in the warm, low-altitude regions of eastern and southern Africa. The current study revealed that C. partellus is expanding its distribution into the high elevations of the eastern Highveld region of South Africa. The only stem borer already found there (elevation 1,600 m) is Busseola fusca (Fuller). After C. partellus invaded the region, it rapidly increased its share of the total borer population every pear. On maize, it reached 32% of the total borer population within 6 yr and on grain sorghum 59% within 7 yr. The most rapid population increase by C. partellus occurred on the ratoon grain sorghum crop. Within 2 yr it became the predominant borer, constituting approximate to 90% of the total stem borer population. C. partellus has proven to be an efficient colonizer, and it seems to be displacing the indigenous B. fusca. C. partellus survives the dry winters (at subzero temperatures) of the Highveld region in South Africa by diapausing low in the dry stalks, often beneath the soil. Hibernating larval populations of C. partellus terminate diapause and emerge as moths approximate to 1 mo earlier than B. fusca. This enables C. partellus to infest the grain sorghum ratoon crop before B. fusca, thus becoming the predominant borer in this niche. The life cycle of C. partellus is 3 wk shorter than that of B. fusca, which gives it a further competitive advantage because of its higher potential rate of increase.	30	WOS:A1997YH00300011	42	Busseola fusca; Chile partellus; stem borer; competitive displacement; maize; sorghum	SUMMER GRAIN CROPS; STALK-BORERS; DIAPAUSE TERMINATION; STEM BORER; MAIZE; SWINHOE; SORGHUM; AFRICA; KENYA; COAST	Kfir, R	1997	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum)	NONE

The combined ANOVA showed that there were no significant differences observed between main and ratoon crops and the treatment interactions for the qualitative and quantitative component traits of sugar yield measured and also no significant differences observed for main and ratoon crop except for non-significant numerical differences giving a trend. The stalk yield was highest for treatments T5 and T6 in main crop and in the ratoon crop however, the treatment T4 recorded the highest stalk yield.	0	WOS:000327934600008	24	Sweet sorghum; Micronutrients; Tropics; Sugar yield; Stalk yield; Main crop; Ratoon crop	BICOLOR-L.

No information is available on these impacts when manure is applied to soils at different rates and frequencies. Manure from lactating dairy cows (Bos taurus) fed three diets differing in crude protein (CP) content were applied to a Plano (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls) and a Rosholt (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs) sod at two application rates (225 or 450 kg total N ha(-1)) and three application frequencies (once, twice, or thrice). Oat (Avena sativa L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and sorghum ratoon were grown in succession during a 170-d period. Plant responses to manure from different CP diets were much less than responses due to soil type and manure application rate and frequency. Manure N uptake efficiency by plants was greatest for manure derived from a low-CP diet than manure derived from either the medium- or high-CP diets. Manure application rate and frequency increased NO3 levels in oat and sorghum shoots, which if used as forage could have detrimental impacts on dairy cow health. No significant differences were measured in secondcrop (sorghum) yield or N uptake due to a previous manure application at either N application rate. Third-crop (sorghum ratoon) yield and N uptake were significantly increased, however, due to previous manure applications, but only in pots that received two manure applications at the high rate. Longer term, repeated applications of dairy manure derived from different diets at lower rates could provide more pronounced impacts on plants and soils than those observed during this relatively short-term greenhouse study.	8	WOS:000248103200026	32	NONE	NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; CATTLE MANURE; PHOSPHORUS; FATE; MINERALIZATION; EFFICIENCY; PROTEIN; FARMS; YIELD; COWS	Wu, Zhonghong; Powell, J.

Wats. var motia Burk.] at Bangalore. The intercropping systems were palmarosa + cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], palmarosa + blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) and palmarosa + greengram (Phaseolus radiatus L.) during 1986-87, and palmarosa + blackgram-blackgram, palmarosa + sorghum grain [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.]-blackgram and palmarosa + sorghum fodder-ratoon during 1987-88. The results showed that the intercropping of blackgram-blackgram or sorghum fodder-ratoon gave additions yields of 660 kg/ha seed and 16.6 tonnes/ha fodder respectively compared with the sole crop of palmarosa. Land-use efficiency in these intercropping systems increased by 24 and 9% respectively.	4	WOS:A1994NW45000003	0	NONE	NONE	RAO, EVSP; SINGH, M; RAO, RSG	1994	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum)	NONE

An attempt has been made to critically identify the factors contributing to biomass yield and their interrelationship in sweet sorghum plant (main) and ratoon trials. The genotypes ICSSH 28, ICSSH 58, ICSA 749 x SPV 1411, B-24 and ICSV 93046 exhibited higher ratooning efficiency. It was observed that higher the ratooning efficiency lower will be the difference between the growing degree days (GDD) of main and ratoon crop. GDD can be used as one of the selection criteria in breeding programs aiming for enhanced biomass and ratooning efficiency.	0	WOS:000327935300008	20	Sweet sorghum; Main crop; Ratoon crop; Biomass; Growing degree days; Photo thermal units	NONE	Rao, P.

Whereas relationships between dairy diets, milk production, manure N excretion, and urine N losses as ammonia have been documented, very little information exists on how diets impact fecal carbon (C), N content, and partitioning, and how these factors impact fecal N mineralization and plant N uptake after application to soil. Feces from 24 to 63 dairy cows (Bos taurus) fed 14 typical diets were incubated aerobically in a sandy loam and two silt loam soils, and soil inorganic N (IN) was determined periodically during a 365-d period. Feces from 12 of the 14 diets were applied to the same soils and oat (Avena sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), and sorghum ratoon dry matter (DM) and N uptake were determined over a 155-d period. Feces from cows fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silage (AS)-based diets generally lead to higher soil IN levels than soils amended with feces from corn (Zea mays L.) silage (CS)-based diets, especially in soils amended with feces from CS-low crude protein (LCP) diets; feces from AS-based diets increased plant DM and N uptake; after application to a silt loam, feces from high crude protein (HCP) diets resulted in greater soil IN levels than feces from LCP diets; and feces from LCP diets did not impact soil IN but decreased plant DM and N uptake. Carbon to N (C/N) ratios of applied feces were found to be significant predictors of plant DM and N uptake. There appears to be a range of dietary options that satisfy nutritional requirements of high-producing dairy cows and produce feces having differential effects on soil N mineralization and plant N uptake after application to soil.	27	WOS:000237344500010	29	NONE	SILAGE-BASED DIETS; ANIMAL MANURE; PROTEIN-LEVEL; ALFALFA; CATTLE; N-15	Powell, JM; Wattiaux, MA; Broderick, GA; Moreira, VR; Casler, MD	2006	TS=(ratoon* NEAR/5 sorghum)	NONE
